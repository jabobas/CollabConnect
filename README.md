# CollabConnect - Course Project for COS457

CollabConnect is an application that facilitates collaboration and connection between academics and industry professionals. It addresses the gap between wanting or needing a collaborator for a project and finding a suitable collaborator. The app will provide users the opportunity to search a directory of potential collaborators and view attributes of professional peers that make them a good match for the proposed project. A user may also visualize graphs of connections between professionals for better decision-making and understanding.
