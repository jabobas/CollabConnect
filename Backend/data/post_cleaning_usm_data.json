He received his Ph.D. in Computational Sciences Mathematics under the direction of James Lambers, where he developed a stencil selection algorithm with an adaptive mesh refinement method for upscaling transmissibility in subsurface flow simulations. This work has applications in controlling groundwater contamination and predicting the escape rates of sequestered carbon dioxide.His current research interest is numerical linear algebra for high-performance computing and deep learning. Dr. Quinlan is a recognized educator. The Northeastern Section of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) awarded him the 2023 Distinguished University Teaching Award for his contributions inside and outside the classroom. Subsequently, he was nominated for the Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo Awards for Distinguished Teaching (the highest teaching honor bestowed by the MAA). Dr. Quinlans leadership and expertise extend beyond the classroom. He has played a pivotal role in program development, notably contributing to creating one of the nations first data science programs. His efforts also helped establish a fully online graduate program in data science at the University of Rhode Island. In addition to his contributions to numerical analysis and scientific computing, Dr. Quinlan has designed and taught various computer science, mathematics, and data science courses, covering essential topics such as data structures and algorithms, database design and implementation, and data exploration in R. Dr. Quinlan is currently the co-editor of theNorth American GeoGebra Journaland is involved in the TEA Journal Project, a global collaboration of 60 authors worldwide. This project fostered six research groups dedicated to researching the role of artificial intelligence in computer science and mathematics education. Dr. Quinlan is a past member of the MAAs national Committee on Technologies in Mathematics Education (CTME), and the webmaster for its regional section. Personal Website",

Since arriving at USM, I have done work in video microscopy of Brownian motion, granular materials, and created the state of Maines first course in Computational Physics. I have been increasing my efforts in Computational Physics, most recently abandoning Python in favor of the far speedier Julia Language, to which I have contributed to the package ecosystem. I am also working on two different experiments: one involving the simulation and measurement of a rotating conducting ring in a static magnetic field, and another on building a sensitive torstion pendulum to measure small magnetic field fluctuations. I am also working to add computational physics problem set questions to all of our upper level physics courses. To find out more, please go toportlandphysics.me",

He is a biochemist who studies how microbial stress protectants can be harnessed for the development of new antibiotics. Dr. Woodruff regularly teaches Biochemistry (CHY 461), Biochemistry Laboratory (CHY 462), and Biochemistry II (CHY 463), as well as the Chemistry Capstone (CHY 470). Dr. Woodruff is also the director of the Quality Control Collaboratory (QC2), which offerslaboratory analysis and testing for the craft beverage industry, while providing authentic lab experience and research opportunities for USM undergraduate students.If youre interested in conducting biomedical research in the Woodruff Lab, or becoming a lab technician at QC2, please email Dr. Woodruff to discuss joining the lab. Research interests Biochemistry is the study of how chemical principles can explain biological systems, and be used to address pressing issues such as infectious disease.The Woodruff Lab is focused on trehalose, a microbial stress protectant not found in humans, but present in pathogens such asMycobacterium tuberculosisandClostridioidesdifficile. Altering the structure of trehalose can result in a potent antimicrobial compound that interferes with bacterial metabolism. Unfortunately, it can take months of work to synthesize even a small amount of one of these compounds using traditional organic chemistry, limiting their utility. However, living organisms synthesize trehalose quickly using enzymatic systems.We are using the enzyme TreT, which bacteria use to synthesize trehalose from simple substrates. If we feed an altered, commercially-available substrate to the enzyme, it will turn it into an altered trehalose. Unlike traditional organic synthesis, we can go from reaction to pure compound in as little as one hour. This allows us to ask questions and perform experiments that werent possible before. Students who work in the Woodruff Lab are exposed to a variety of synthetic and analytical techniques, including genetic engineering, bacterial culture, protein purification, enzymatic assays, small molecule synthesis, purification (HPLC/column chromatography), and NMR. This work is funded by the National Institutes of Health. If youre interested in joining the Woodruff Lab, send me an email or stop by!",

I have a passion for working with medically complex and fragile populations as well as in the area of dysphagia. I maintain my Certificate of Clinical Competence SLP through the American Speech-Language Hearing Association as well as my Maine state license as an SLP. I have supervised clinical fellow students and Speech Language Pathology Assistants in the school and acute/outpatient settings. I received my Master of Science in Speech Language Pathology, in May 2013 from Seton Hall University. I received a Research Award at graduation and was inducted into Alpha Eta Honor Society for Allied Health. I worked as a Research Lab Assistant in the Reading, Oral Language and Writing Lab at Seton Hall University. In this lab, I conducted research with my academic supervisor, Dr. Anthony Koutsoftas involving the writing process, specifically cohesion and coherence, in children who have language learning disabilities. I presented two posters in this area of research at the American Speech-Language, Hearing Associations (ASHA) Annual Convention; Written Discourse Coherence in Children with Language Learning Disabilities, November 2011 in San Diego, California, and Written Discourse Cohesion in Children with Language Learning Disabilities, November 2013 in Chicago, Illinois. I also published an article with Dr. Anthony Koutsoftas in the International Journal of Language & Communication Disorders, Written cohesion in children with and without language learning disabilities, 30 December 2016. Additionally, I conducted research in pediatric dysphagia with Dr. Nina Capone while at Seton Hall University, which I was second author on a poster presentation at ASHAs Annual Convention in Chicago, Illinois in November 2013, titled Pediatric Dysphagia: A Test for the Hierarchical Support Between Oral Structures. I hope to continue conducting clinical research in this field and be an active member of the community.",

Professor El-Taha is an active scholar with national and international reputation. He is the author and coauthor of numerous research articles published in highly visible, peer reviewed international journals. His research interests are broad and cover a wide spectrum of interests that vary from the theoretical to the applied.Professor El-Tahas primary area of scholarship is modeling and analysis of stochastic systems, with emphasis on queueing networks and their applications to computer and communications systems. His research is widely cited and recognized in his field. The wide applicability of his research laps into his teaching, where he constructs a variety of class projects for his students. Professor El-Taha is a primary national expert of an approach in queueing theory known as Sample-Path Analysis. Sample-path analysis uses a deterministic approach to analyze stochastic systems, primarily queueing and more general input output system.Professor El-Tahas early research focused on sample-path analysis which culminated in his book, Sample-Path Analysis of Queueing Systems (co-authored with S. Stidham). The book was awarded the 1999 Best Publication Award by the Applied Probability section of INFORMS (the Institute of Operations Research and Management Science). The award recognizes the most outstanding contribution to the field of Applied Probability published during 1997-1998. Since then this book has been widely used in postgraduate queueing courses as a text and a reference book.Professor El-Tahas authored and co-authored research articles have appeared in reputable journals. This includes Management Science, Stochastic Models, Queueing Systems: Theory and Applications, Performance Evaluation, Theoretical Computer Science, Computers and Operations Research, European Journal of Operations Research (EJOR), Discrete Event Dynamic Systems, Operations Research Letters, Journal of Applied Mathematics and Stochastic Analysis, Statistical Planning and Inference, Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management, among others. Professor El-Taha was also involved in Biostatistical consulting and research in a joint effort with researchers at CORRONA (The Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America), NYU Medical Center/Hospital for Joint Diseases, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, and University of Massachusetts Medical School to study Rheumatoid arthritis, its effects on human body and effective treatments. This effort has generated several abstracts in refereed proceedings published by two reputable journals in the field: Annals of rheumatic diseases and Arthritis and Rheumatism. Professor El-Taha also has multiple technical reports on research and consulting related to Rheumatoid Arthritis, and additional abstracts that appeared in EULAR (The European League against Rheumatism) and ACR (American College of Rheumatology) conferences. Professor El-Taha previously served as Department chair and the Director of the Graduate Program in Statistics. He also served on the Graduate Council. Professor El-Taha regularly teaches upper and graduate level Applied Mathematics and Operations Research courses. He also taught Management Science and Business Analytics, and Data analytics for the School of Business, and Computer Simulation and Computer Performance Modeling for the Computer Science Department.",

His teaching and studio practice revolve around creative engagement with habitat and community. Before joining the faculty at the University of Southern Maine, he developed the Art + Ecology program at the University of Kansas that enabled students to study environmental issues and topics through combined creative practice and critical inquiry. While at KU, he held a dual appointment in Visual Art and Environmental Studies and he also served as department Chair. His teaching is deeply influenced by the work of Rudolf Stiener and the Waldorf school movement. He is a member of the New Perennial Project, a creative ecology collective associated with The Land Institute in Salina, Kansas. Matts creative works span a range of materials and interests. Through constructed objects, outdoor installations, and interactive works, he seeks to direct attention to the inherent interconnectedness among the world. Recent projects include, The Sun Hive Project, a collaborative effort with his Sustainable Art class that furnished beehives for local Kansas farmers; and the Neighborhood Pocket Libraries Project, which utilized reclaimed lumber to produce small libraries sited in residential neighborhoods. In June 2017, he exhibited When We Hear Water, at the Salina Art Center, which focused on the expansive sound of falling water. Matt received his B.A. from Colby College and his M.F.A. in Sculpture from Queens College, C.U.N.Y. He has had numerous solo and group shows including, PS1 MoMA in Queens, NY, the Hopper House Art Center in Nyack, NY, the Brooklyn Museum of Art in NY, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, among others. His work is in several museums and collections including, the Museum of Modern Art Library, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and the Cleveland Institute of Art Library. He lives in Topsham, Maine with his wife, Melissa and son, Angus and is grateful for the many wonderful people in his life. WEBSITE",

Interested in transferring her thoughts into tangible forms, she began to draw. Her work is often narrative based and a reflection of her thoughts on domesticity and the mundaneness of culture. Her research results in prints, book arts, and paintings that explore the act of moving from one culture or language to another, cast against a corresponding, more inexorable move from childhood to adulthood. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally in museums and galleries and is in numerous private and public collections, including the Dayton Metro Library in Dayton, Ohio, Harold Washington Public Library in Chicago and the Joan Flash Artists Book Collection in Chicago, IL. Annie Lee-Zimerle has held solo exhibitions at SpringfieldMuseum of Art, Kent State University, and Paper Circle Southeast Ohios Center for Paper and Book Arts, among other locations. She recently was an artist in residence at Cleveland Institute of Art and at the Studios at MASS MoCA. She was also featured onThe Art Showon PBS. WEBSITE",

They have exhibited widely across the globe, most recently with solo shows at Burlington City Arts and the Center for Maine Contemporary Art. tectonic industriesexamine the artifice inherent within the creation of the modern myths and belief systems of popular culture. Ultimately these created worlds become a pervasive form of reality, universally meaningful within the mainstream collective memory. At the heart of the investigation lies a fascination with visual, literal, televisual and cinematic pop culture that centers on appearances and narrative. Borrowed language is distorted, manipulated and morphed to heighten the artificial. Referencing immediately identifiable cultural signifiers in conjunction with our seemingly endless quest for self-improvement, tectonic industries create mixed-media installations that scrutinize our all-encompassing desire for instant gratification and immediate satisfaction.

He has previously taught at various colleges and in addition to his teaching at the University of Southern Maine, is currently the lead mountmaker at the Penn Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology whose collection has significant influence on his art. He draws inspiration from the science, history, and memory of objects from the human built environment. His process is centered on replication but fully embraces generation loss; whether that loss is from the transmutation of material or the filter of his consciousness. His work is often the physical diminished replica; leaving an object that bears little semblance to the original yet retains a charged presence. He has shown his work regionally and nationally, including the Springfield Museum of Art, the Zanesville Museum of art, the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, and other galleries and institutions. In addition, he has collaborated with archaeologists utilizing his ceramic skills to recreate Sumerian ceramic vessels that were used to brew ancient beer recipes in collaboration with the brewmasters at Great Lakes Brewing Company.",

After dropping out of Mass College of Art in 1979, Amy Hagberg went on to work at Kaji Aso Studio in Boston, a cooperative art studio space, working primarily in watercolor and pastels. After canoeing down the Mississippi River the summer of 1983 with a group of fellow artists, Amy felt the need to return to the water. For the next two decades Amy Hagberg worked in the Marne Industry, graduating from the Landing School in Arundel Maine in both Boatbuilding and Yacht Design, and earning her 100-ton USCG Captains License. In 2002 it was time for a change, and Amy fell in love with the magic of the darkroom. She got a job at the University of Southern Maines Bookstore, and went back to school at USM. In 2010 Amy Hagberg graduated Summa Cum Laude with a BA in Studio Art with a concentration in photography. In 2014 Amy received her MFA in Visual Arts from Lesley Universitys College of Art and Design. Amys current work utilizes hand-made pinhole cameras that use 8 X 10 photographic paper for the negatives. The slow exposures of this process act as a vehicle for the investigation of time, mirroring the vagaries of the life experience. Amy is an artist member and board member of the Oquinquit Arts Association and lives in the woods of Limerick, Maine. She has worked for the Art Department since the spring of 2016. WEBSITE",

Dr. Schmitts research focuses on the ways students and teachers make sense of themselves as well as the past, present, and future within the classroom, and in public spaces such as museums and monuments. He is particularly interested in how identity comes into play in meaning-making about the past, as well as how people make sense of information that challenges their worldview. At USM, he teaches courses on elementary and secondary social studies methods, and the connections between democracy and education. He also teaches courses on the history of American education and the intersections between memory and history for the History Department.

For over 50 years she has devoted her work, teaching, scholarship and service to the amelioration of poverty and to the plight of low-income people in the US. With a focus on social policy, her work unearths the politics of policy-making as well as the impact of ideology, public opinion and discriminatory stereotypes on policy exposing resultant social, economic, and personal consequences. Scholarship concentrated on welfare policy focuses on both its restrictive nature and its corresponding impact and effect on recipients, most particularly low-income single-mothers pursuing post-secondary education. The power of higher education in sustaining privilege and its resultant impact on thwarting access to low-income parents emerges in these investigations.Recent writings focus on the long-standing tenuous nature of safety net programs in the US. After a 40-year career of teaching, writing, community service, and an array of administrative positions, she retired from USM in 2015. While at USM, she served in a diverse array of roles including Director of the then-Women and Gender Studies Program, Union President, Faculty Representative to the Board of Trustees, NEASC Accreditation facilitator, and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Early in her career she was Community Organizer at the Fuld Neighborhood Center in Newark (NJ) and later a Policy Analyst for the Jersey City (NJ) Model Cities Program. In 1973 she was the Director of Childrens Mental Health for the then-Department of Mental Health and Corrections (ME) and initiated the closure of the Childrens Psychiatric Center at the then-Pineland Hospital and Training Center (formerly the Maine Center for the Feeble-Minded). She now lends her knowledge and expertise to work with non-profit organizations, government agencies, and state legislatures while continuing to be an active contributor to state and national policy discussions and debates that focus on vulnerable populations. She currently serves as a Commissioner of the Portland (ME) Housing Authority, a member of TEMPOart Portland, the Maine Alliance for a Healthy and Prosperous Maine, and the Maine Hunger Initiative: Ending Hunger in Maine by 2030, and is as well as a college essay writing volunteer at The Telling Room.",

Professor Lazs best known publications explore the social construction of age (Act Your Age,Sociological Forum1998; Age Embodied,Journal of Aging Studies2003). Other research focused on food systems, particularly on alternatives to the industrialized food system. During her 33 years at USM, Professor Laz served in a variety of leadership roles, including as department chair, chair of the Core Curriculum Committee, and chair of the University Curriculum Committee.

In her early research, published in journals includingMedieval Feminist Forum, Journal of Early Modern Studies, and College Literature,Dr. Brockman used reception studies and trauma theory to trace the specific ways writers deploy narratives of sexual violence in epic literature and its adaptations. Her current research calls on her background in raptor training to examine literary representations of falconry (the art of hunting with birds of prey) in medieval and early modern England. Dr. Brockman has taught at universities in New York, Colorado, and North Carolina, on topics ranging from literary theory to technical writing to advanced seminars in Chaucer and Shakespeare. At USM, she teaches College Writing, Academic Writing, and World Literature. When shes not at USM, you can find her spending time with her family, birdwatching, or roller skating.",

Theo has a Ph.D. in Limnology & Oceanography from the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he studied long-term dynamics in fish community structure of Northern Wisconsin Lakes. While at Madison he developed skills in large data set manipulation and analysis. In 2003 he spent 6 months in the Jackson Lab at University of Toronto refining his skills in multivariate analysis. In 2004 he started a position with Maine Rivers and, in 2005, moved to Robbinston, Maine to study the interactions between smallmouth bass and alewife, an anadromous river herring native to East Coast rivers. In 2006 Theo developed an adjunct association with the Dept. of Environmental Science at the University of Southern Maine and the School of Marine Sciences at the University of Maine. Through these associations Dr. Willis developed a restoration ecology program focused on anadromous fish in Maine. His projects included restoration evaluation, molecular genetics, fish mark-recapture, food web ecology in the Gulf of Maine and Maine rivers, elver migration timing, alewife population dynamics and demographics and river herring passage/ swimming abilities. His current projects include interaction between alewife restoration, management, the alewife fishery and citizen science. He also works with Maine indigenous peoples on diadromous fish restoration. One of the most rewarding things for Theo is bringing undergraduates into the world of fish ecology. This model works out well at USM because of the maturity and focus of returning students that make up much of ESP. He supervises one to two undergraduates a year on existing projects and new research. Undergrads are encouraged to present progress on their work at regional meetings. Theo focuses on developing quantitative skills with his mentored students and encourages them to consider graduate school when appropriate, particularly when those undergraduates follow through on a project and produce publications for peer review.",

As with many anthropologists, my life is one where I practice anthropology every day I like to observe people: how they behave; how they create their physical and cultural environments; and what they believe. In fact, since I have lived in several countries and immigrated to U.S. when I was a teenager, I have always obsessively observed how differences in customs, interactions, and physical spaces, translated into thematic templates of countries and their peoples. Teaching anthropology, for me, is apassionand is as muchsharingmy knowledge and observations as it islearningfrom my students at USM/LAC, where I have been since 1998. Some courses that I have taught are:Cultural Anthropology; Health Illness and Culture; Ethnicity, Immigration and Identity; Deviance and Social Control; Family; Food, Culture and Eating.One of my favoritesisFables Do Come True Fairy Tales and National Character,which incorporates readings of fairy tales from different cultures and six films, also from different cultures. As one can imagine, there is much to discover and discuss, with such a rich tapestry of textual and visual material. Though I majored in biology, as an undergraduate at Harvard College, I was also fascinated by Ethnobotany, studying with the inspiring Richard Schultes, and cultural anthropology, with primate ethologist, Irving Devore. It was in his class that I started on my first photo-documentary book,Rural Maine,published in 1972.There were several other books that incorporated both oral history and documentary photography, in the years to follow. At Boston University, where I earned my PhD in Medical Anthropology, I also maintained my interest in photography. Fascinated by how we use plants, symbolically, spiritually, and practically, and becoming involved in organic farming, in local healthful food production initiatives, and in organizing farmers markets, I co-authored two well received books,TheComplete Book of Everlastings, which focused on horticulture and ethno-historical uses of dried flowers, andGrowing Herbs and Vegetables From Seed to Harvest,also documenting historical uses of domesticated plants and providing horticultural how to instructions for gardeners. What do I do in my free time? I dont really have much free time, where I dont do what I already love doing for work and practice a seeming continuum, by relishing my life in a small rural town of Sumner, Maine, where I have learned to garden and be outdoors, to build buildings, to repair machinery, to do community organizing, to become an integral part of the town government, and to contribute time to small non-profit community organizations.",

As a macro social worker at the administrative level, she has experience in philanthropic development through grant writing, event planning, program planning, and program evaluation. As a public administrator, Dr. Ivey is a tactful planner and is methodological in integrating various macro strategies to sustain and expand nonprofit programs. The focus of Dr. Iveys research is the exploration of African American individual, familial, societal, and systemic manifestations that highlight ways in which policies and social workers can be more responsive to the needs of grandparents raising grandchildren, Alzheimers caregivers, and other marginalized populations. Dr. Iveys scholarship is motivated by the strength and resilience of the African American family in the face of generational systemic racism. Representing those stories of struggle and triumph in a historic and contemporary context that often pathologized African American families were inspired in her early scholarship. Her research continues to evolve based on her experience as a professor, administrator, scholar, and artist; however, the common theme of her inquiry is to give voice to those often overlooked with the intention of supporting agency and advocacy. Dr. Ivey is an established artist and family historian concentrating on preserving generational history, genealogy, and by creating legacy statements using encaustic mediums. As an administrator, she aims to provide access, retention, and completion of social work education for students regardless of age, ethnicity, ability, gender, and/or religion.
