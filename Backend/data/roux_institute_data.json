Most recently, Forlines founded and ran a startup company focused on hardware and software human-sensing systems. Forlines lives just south of Portland and feels lucky to have ended up both 10 minutes from downtown and 10 minutes to some of the best trails and beaches southern Maine has to offer. Forlines works within the Roux Institute\u2019s Human-Data Interaction team to design and build sensing and presentation systems with research and industry partners. Recent efforts have focused on inexpensively understanding user\u2019s cognitive and emotional states and in better presenting the output of computational medicine algorithms to decision-makers in healthcare.",
