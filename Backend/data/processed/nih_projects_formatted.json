Our Research Program is focused on uncovering \nthe underlying genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional mechanisms that drive aging-associated cellular \ndysfunction, chronic inflammation, and immune dysfunction, and their profound contributions to cancer. By \ndelving into these fundamental processes, we strive to gain insights into cancer development, dissemination, \nand treatment resistance to develop age-tailored interventions. Our Program has been focused on exploring \nthe genomic complexity of cancer and how the tumor and the host interact. Building on our success, we are \nnow extending these studies to include the dimension of time by incorporating aspects of aging pathobiology. \nOur research is organized around three complementary and interrelated Specific Aims. Aim 1 seeks to \nuncover cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms contributing to tumor progression and treatment resistance and how \naging impacts them. Aim 2 seeks to dissect the complexity of immune and stromal components of the tumor \nmicroenvironment and their associations with genetics and aging. Aim 3 seeks to decipher and modulate \naging-associated pathology at the organismal level to prevent tumor progression and treatment resistance. All \nthree Aims draw on the JAXCC\u2019s longstanding strengths in the genetics, development, and analysis of \norganismal, cellular, and computational models, with a focus on how aging and genetic background contribute \nto the physiology of cancer. The 59 JAXCC members include 37 full Program members and 22 Affiliate \nmembers. The Program is supported by $9.99M in annual direct costs from NCI and other peer-reviewed \ncancer-related grants. Over four years of the current grant cycle, JAXCC Program members published 377 \ncancer-relevant research articles: 45% were in journals with impact factor >10, 27% have JAXCC co-authors, \nand 60% have external co-authors, of which 41% include authors from other NCI-designated Cancer Centers. \nThe CCSG has enabled the development of key platforms impactful for our members\u2019 research, including \nsingle cell biology, spatial biology, and tumor-host interactions. The has CCSG supported aging and cancer \nresearch trainees through a new Brooks Scholars program and a series of workshops and think tanks in \ncollaboration with other Cancer Centers. The JAXCC will work closely with the JAX Center for Aging Research, \nwhich includes the NIA-funded Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging and the \nInterventions Testing Program, to enable our members to leverage aging expertise and aged genetically \nheterogeneous animal models. The efforts of the Co-Program Leaders and JAXCC Senior Leadership have \nfostered interactivity among members and engaged their participation in planning for resource development \nand faculty recruitment through monthly Research Program meetings, collaborative projects, subsidized intercampus \ntravel, and the JAXCC Annual Retreat.",

Spatial transcriptomic approaches are revolutionizing our understanding of cancer\ninitiation, progression, and drug resistance by revealing expression patterns with tissue morphological context.\nHowever, these approaches have not yet been applied to the interdisciplinary biology of aging-driven cancers,\ndespite the likelihood that intratissue and microenvironmental evolution mediate the aging phenotype. Moreover,\nthe majority of current single cell spatial projects are based on 3' short read RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and\ntherefore lack the ability to detect full-length spliced isoforms, which are frequently observed in tumors and are\nknown to impact tumor initiation and treatment response. Work from us and others has revealed widespread\nalterations in alternative RNA splicing in human tumors, including in breast cancer, and that half of all spliced\nisoforms detected in human breast tumors using long-read sequencing (LR-seq) are missed by RNA-seq and\nabsent from reference transcriptomes. In addition, we have causally linked the upregulation of specific splicing\nfactors with breast tumor initiation both in vitro and in vivo and identified age-dependent changes in spliced\nisoforms in cancer-associated genes in mammary epithelial cells. Together, these results suggest that alternative\nsplicing is a critical mechanism underlying tumor initiation with age, and that spatial LR-seq approaches are\nrequired to resolve these mechanisms. However, standardized approaches and resources to measure, quantify,\nand visualize expression of full-length isoforms within tissues are lacking. This gap in infrastructure impedes the\nfield's ability to identify cell populations that express age-dependent isoforms, how such isoforms impact cancer\ninitiation for example through changes in receptor-ligand interactions. To address these infrastructure and\nknowledge gaps, we will first develop approaches to map and analyze full-length RNA isoforms spatially\nwithin tissue sections (R21 phase, Aim 1). These tools, which merge LR-seq and spatial transcriptomics, will\nbe applicable across sample types and will therefore be of broad, sustainable utility to the research community.\nWe will then apply these technologies to generate a spatial map of full-length RNA isoforms in healthy\nbreast tissues and tumors during aging (R33 phase, Aims 2 and 3). Finally, we will develop data sharing\nand visualization tools for spatial isoform expression to enable others to mine our data via a web resource\n(R33 phase, Aim 4). To achieve these goals, this project will leverage the complementary and interdisciplinary\nexpertise of the Anczukow lab in alternative splicing and breast cancer, and of the Chuang lab in systems biology\nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. In response to NOT-CA-22-002, Notice of NCI's Participation in PAR-20-\n070, this project will deliver a spatial transcriptomic infrastructure for isoform profiling and a critical\ninterdisciplinary data resource for aging and cancer researchers to understand the role of splicing in tissue aging\nand oncogenesis, thereby advancing approaches for cancer early detection, intervention, and prevention.",

                                    "project_description": "SUMMARY\nAlternative RNA splicing is a key step in gene expression regulation and contributes to transcriptional diversity\nby selecting which transcript isoforms are produced in a specific cell at a specific time point. Aberrantly spliced\nisoforms can impact every one of the hallmarks of cancer, including increased cell proliferation, migration, or\nresistance to apoptosis. Regulatory splicing factors (SFs) have recently emerged as a new class of oncoproteins\nand tumor suppressors. In particular, the tumorigenic capacity of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC, which\nis dysregulated in >50% of human tumors, has been shown to be dependent on the splicing machinery and on\nat least 3 SFs directly regulated by MYC. However, we currently do not have a comprehensive understanding of\nwhich component(s) of the splicing machinery are regulated by MYC, or of the functions of MYC-induced spliced\nisoforms. The goal of this proposal is to systematically characterize the mechanisms by which MYC-regulated\nSFs and spliced isoforms drive tumor growth and maintenance. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, in\nour preliminary studies we used a mammary cell line harboring an inducible form of MYC to greatly expand the\nnumber of known SFs regulated by MYC. We uncovered that MYC activation promotes alternative splicing of\n>4,000 isoforms and expression of 125 SFs. These SFs are also upregulated in MYC-active breast tumors and\ncan be grouped, based on co-expression, into groups or modules. Six SF-modules highly correlate with MYC\nactivity in breast tumors and cell lines, and are enriched in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Which of these\nSFs play a role in MYC-driven transformation, and whether co-expression of multiple MYC-induced SFs has a\nstronger tumorigenic effect than individual SFs, is not known. Further, co-expression analysis in 33 TCGA tumors\nof different tissue origin identified an SF-module shared across all MYC-active tumors, suggesting a pan-cancer\nvulnerability. We hypothesize that MYC regulates a network of SFs which cooperate in tumor pathogenesis and\nthat disrupting this network could provide a novel strategy to slow growth of MYC-driven tumors. Here, we will\nleverage our expertise in RNA splicing and cancer biology and apply a functional genomics approach to gain\nnovel insights into MYC's oncogenicity. Aim 1 will characterize the function of 6 MYC-induced SF modules and\ntheir splicing targets in TNBC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Since it is unknown whether MYC regulates a\nshared set of isoforms in distinct tissues, Aim 2 will identify pan-cancer splicing signatures predictive of MYC\nactivity and clinical outcomes, which may serve as clinical biomarkers, and will deliver putative neo-antigens\ngenerated from MYC-induced isoforms. Finally, Aim 3 will implement genomic approaches to determine which\nMYC-induced isoforms are essential for the growth of MYC-driven cancer cells and patient-derived organoids.\nThis project will reveal fundamental mechanisms by which oncogenic SFs and their target spliced isoforms drive\ntumorigenesis downstream of MYC. These results could help inform development of therapeutic strategies for\ntumors driven by MYC, which remains an undruggable target.",

In the parent grant to\nthis supplement, we have established The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Cellular Senescence Network Tissue\nMapping Center (JAX-Sen TMC) focused on the analysis of mouse tissue to address a significant research and\nclinical need for improved biomarkers and cellular maps of senescence. Advances in our understanding of\nbiological aging and the recognition of aging as a modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases and geriatric\nsyndromes are fueling a growing interest in the cellular underpinnings of the aging process. Despite recent\nprogress in cellular senescence research and the discovery of new senolytics and senomorphics, we lack clear\ninformation regarding the role of cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease, and the effect of genetic\nvariation on these phenomena. In the JAX-Sen TMC we are mapping senescent cells in the context of multiple\nage-matched tissues of genetically defined mouse cohorts, raised in standardized environments throughout their\nlifespan and defining senescent cell phenotypes associated to features of genetics, age and senolytic\ninterventions. The tissues of specific focus within the JAX-Sen TMC are kidney, pancreas, heart, and placenta.\nThis supplement aims to generate detailed tissue mapping data on the mouse pancreas and kidney derived from\nour senescence inducers study and perform the analysis of this data using our existing framework. Specifically,\nwe will employ bulk RNA-seq, H&E, CODEX multiplexed antibody imaging, and Xenium in situ RNA spatial\nprofiling.

The NIA\nInterventions Testing Program (ITP) evaluates drugs proposed to extend mouse lifespan by retardation of\naging or postponement of late life diseases. Interventions proposed by multiple collaborating scientists from the\nresearch community are tested, in parallel, at three sites (The Jackson Laboratory, University of Michigan and\nUniversity of Texas), using very similar, standardized protocols, and using enough genetically heterogeneous\nmice to provide 80% power for detecting changes in lifespan of 10%, for either sex, after pooling data from any\ntwo of the test sites. One hundred and two such lifespan experiments, involving various doses of 66 distinct\nagents, have been initiated in the first twenty years of the ITP. Thirty-six experiments have involved\ncomparative tests of multiple doses of effective agents, variable starting ages, or alternative dosing schedules.\nStatistically significant effects on longevity, in one or both sexes, have been documented and then confirmed\nfor NDGA, rapamycin, acarbose, 17-\u03b1-estradiol (17aE2), and canagliflozin. Significant effects were also noted\nfor Protandim, glycine, meclizine, captopril, and astaxanthin. Lifespan trials are now underway for 25 new\nagents. ITP survival results have also documented longevity benefits from four agents started in middle-age:\nrapamycin, acarbose, 17aE2, and canagliflozin. A Collaborative Interactions Program (CIP) has provided\ntissues from ITP drug-treated mice to an open, growing, international network of scientific collaborators,\nmeeting 26 requests from 17 distinct laboratories in the previous five-year period. Plans for the next five-year\nperiod include additional lifespan (\"Stage 1\") studies, detailed studies (\"Stage 2\") of drugs found to increase\nlifespan, transition from the CIP to an Interventions Biospecimens Repository, additional diagnostic specificity\nin pathological assessments, inclusion of RNA-Seq data in all Stage 2 studies, and comprehensive\npharmacokinetic assessments of drugs found to increase lifespan, as well as continued collaborative work with\na network of scientists to study drug effects on postulated aging mechanisms and links to disease. Site-specific\nstudies at The Jackson Laboratory will add a tests for heart, kidney, and bladder function in Stage 2 studies,\nand image analysis of tissues using machine learning. The work proposed should allow the ITP to continue to\nmake major contributions to mammalian aging biology.",

It is the most common inherited glomerular disease leading to renal failure and is caused by mutations\nin any one of the genes encoding a3, a4, or a5 chains of type IV collagen (COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5,\nrespectively). There is large variation in the age of onset and severity of the disease, even between patients with\nsimilar mutations. Studies in mice have shown that the renal phenotype is highly dependent on the genetic\nbackground. It is widely accepted that modifier genes contribute to this variation, which could represent a source\nof novel therapeutic targets in Alport syndrome and other renal diseases. We identified human-relevant modifier\ngenes in a small cohort of genetically diverse mice with a Col4a5 mutation (leading to X-linked Alport syndrome\n(XLAS)) and validated that decreased expression of one of these genes, Fmn1, leads to a less severe renal\nphenotype. We further found that two of the candidate modifier genes (Pik3r1 and Dgke) modulate other forms\nof kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy and hematolytic urea syndrome. In this application we will\ndiscover novel candidate modifier genes of XLAS by high-resolution genetic mapping in a large\ngenetically diverse XLAS mouse cohort and confirm the translational relevance of the modifiers in\nhumans. The functional impact and causality of the modifier genes will be assessed in preclinical mouse\nmodels of XLAS and other forms of kidney disease. We will generate a large, genetically diverse XLAS\nmouse population that, combined with our previous population, will allow us gene-resolution mapping of modifier\nloci (Aim 1). Whole exome sequencing and targeted testing for the detection of the most likely candidate modifier\ngenes in human XLAS pedigrees will be conducted to confirm the translational relevance of the candidate\nmodifier genes found in our mouse studies (Aim 2). We will use available knockout resources and/or CRISPR-\nCas9 gene editing to test causality of as many as five candidate genes in the XLAS mouse model (Aim 3A). We\nwill further test these modifier genes for causality in mouse models of two common forms of kidney disease:\ndiabetic nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis syndrome (Aim 3B). Identification of the genes\nresponsible for the onset and severity of disease will provide meaningful insights into understanding the\nmolecular events underlying the pathogenesis of kidney disease and provide the basis for developing novel\ntherapeutic strategies.",

The overall goal of\nThe Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center (JAX NSC) Research Development Core is to provide support\nfor career development of junior faculty entering the field of basic aging biology or other investigators who wish\nto change career direction towards basic aging research. In 2017, the pilot award format was changed from\nproviding funds awarded to two investigators per year ($50,000 each) to an innovative in-kind program where\nexperiments were streamlined for awardees enabling more experiments to be performed for a larger number of\ninvestigators within the same budget. During the current funding period, the JAX NSC Research Development\nCore competitively awarded funding and resources to aging projects across biological systems that resulted in\nnew discoveries, research publications and sources of funding, and helped junior awardees to establish their\nown independent careers in aging research. Moving forward, these successes will be expanded by providing\ntargeted funding to exciting projects proposed by investigators new to aging research, and by offering a variety\nof research and intellectual resources to support awardees and other aging investigators in their work. The\noutstanding institutional resources available at JAX, a premier institution for mouse genetics and systems biology\nresearch, will be leveraged to sustain and grow this foundation of researchers at JAX and within the aging\ncommunity. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Fund projects for new investigators in aging research using a\ncompetitive pilot award program. Promising investigators new to aging research will be funded through a\ncompetitive process so they can generate the data and gain the expertise necessary to support competitive\nfunding applications and a transition to a career in aging biology. Aim 2. Provide resources to support pilot\nawardees and investigators new to aging research. Access to resources (e.g., aging mice, data, tissues,\nphenotype platforms, expertise) will be provided to support pilot awardees and other investigators new to aging\nresearch. The aging mouse cohorts and phenotyping technologies supported by the JAX NSC present a valuable\nopportunity for investigators to access material and collect data that might otherwise be prohibitively expensive\nor difficult to obtain. Aim 3. Provide mentorship and career development opportunities in aging research.\nInvestigators new to aging research will be provided with mentorship by JAX NSC researchers and collaborators.\nThey will also be given opportunities for career development in the aging field via support with the grant writing\nprocess, opportunities to participate in aging meetings, and introductions to potential collaborations within the\nbroader aging community. The impact of the Research Development Core is that the pool of investigators\ndevoted to the study of the basic biology of aging will be expanded.",

Advanced tools including base and\nprime editors can be used to precisely install single base modifications in a single treatment without inducing\nDNA breaks. A critical component to developing and implementing a genome editor-based therapeutic strategy\nis the availability of validated animal models with clear phenotypic and/or molecular readouts to assess both\nefficacy and safety. Mouse models provide an ideal preclinical testing platform that can recapitulate the\ncomplexity of a given mutation or disease state in the context of a multi-tissue, multi-organ mammalian system.\nThe MMRRC hosts a growing collection of human disease models that will prove invaluable in the testing of\nnovel genome editing-based therapeutics. Cell-based platforms are important for the initial evaluation of\ngenome editing strategies. While human iPS cells or patient-derived fibroblasts are suitable for this purpose,\nthey are slow growing, expensive, non-renewable and/or unavailable resources. Mouse embryonic stem cells\n(mESCs) grow rapidly, are simple to transfect, are renewable, and can be derived directly from preclinical\nmodels that will be used for follow-up in vivo validation. Our team has extensive experience in the generation,\ncharacterization and distribution of mESCs through the MMRRC. The overarching goal of this applied research\ncomponent is to enhance the utility of the MMRRC Resource for translational applications by 1) generating\nnovel mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) resources from important mouse models of human disease and 2)\nto demonstrate the utility of these resources through the implementation of a genome editing therapeutic\ndesign screening platform. The mESC resources will be distributed to the external community, and we will\nexplore the feasibility of deploying our platform as a future external service.",

Tools for human studies\nhave advanced greatly yet there remains a necessary reliance on mammalian models. To this end new strains\nof mice have been created that better emulate the extent of human genetic variation. These strains include\nCollaborative Cross (CC), Diversity Outbred (DO) and recombinant inbred mice (e.g. BXD). The CC/DO and\nBXD platforms harness the natural inbred strain variation needed for systems genetics studies. However, the\nuse of these strains typically requires additional genetic engineering of the mice to create \u201ctool strains\u201d to allow\nspecific types of genetic manipulations. Such strains already exist for standard inbred strains (e.g. C57BL/6J),\nbut \u201ctool strains\u201d, that carry commonly needed genetic manipulations, are not presently available for genetically\ndiverse inbred strains such as CC/DO, BXD, or all of the founder inbred strains used to create these RI panels.\n The use of the powerful CC/DO/BXD strains is growing rapidly and to facilitate efficient use of these mice we\npropose to create a series of tool strains and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). To do this, we will take\nadvantage of diverse inbred strains that harbor novel, high efficiency recombinase-based docking sites to\nfacilitate the use of CRISPR-cas9 editing for creation of the new strains. Validated new tool strains will be\nmade available through the Special Mouse Strain Resource (SMSR).\n To achieve this goal we will:\n Derive and validate germ line competent mESC lines from existing Bxb1 integrase strains. The goal\nhere is to create a panel of genetically diverse mESC lines harboring Bxb1 integrase sites, as well as LSL-\nCas9-FLAG. These mESCs will provide tools for engineering loci that are difficult to engineer in zygotes or for\nvalidation experiments that can be accomplished in vitro.\n Generate Rosa26-LSL-Cas9-FLAG tool strains for CAST/EiJ, PWK/EiJ, and DBA/2J inbred strains.\nThese strains will enable CRISPR/cas9 editing in the absence of exogenous Cas9. This facilitates engineering\nin zygotes and allows for easy, precise engineering of somatic cells/tissues. The goal is to create and validate\nthis important tool strain for the three high priority inbred strain backgrounds listed above.\n Generate germ line deletion tool strains for CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ inbred strain backgrounds.\nRemoval of specific DNA sequences or engineering stop codons is frequently accomplished using flanking\nloxP sites that serve as catalytic domains for cre recombinase. Implementation of this approach frequently\nuses \u201cgerm line cre\u201d strains, that are not currently available on genetically diverse strain backgrounds. Thus,\nthe goal here is to take advantage of our Bxb1 docking site strains to create Rosa26 Sox2-cre knock-in alleles\non CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ.",

Towards this, we will 1) examine the biochemical interactions of the mutant synthetases and their\ncognate tRNAs, 2) explore why only alpha motor neurons and a subset of sensory neurons are affected by these\nmutations, and 3) test the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the integrated stress response, which is activated by\nthese mutations. Much of this work has been done in mouse models of these diseases, but to extend these\nstudies into a human system, we have engineered GARS/CMT2D mutations into a healthy control iPSC line,\nKOLF2, which we can differentiate into motor neurons in vitro. We have encountered two challenges with this\nexperimental system. First, the motor neurons are still immature in culture. We have assessed this in part by\ntesting the extent to which they turn on eEF1A2 and turn off eEF1A1. This developmental switch occurs in the\nfirst few weeks of life in mice, correlating with the onset of neuropathy in our Gars mice, and we believe it to be\ncentral to the cell-type specificity of tRNA synthetase mutations, since eEF1As directly interact with tRNA\nsynthetases and charged tRNAs. Thus, we need to develop sophisticated hiPSC co-culture systems to generate\nmore mature motor neurons that switch more completely to eEF1A2. Second, inhibiting the integrated stress\nresponse in our mouse models is highly efficacious, but the rapid response to inhibition and neurophysiological\nimprovements suggest this benefit is coming from improved transmission at neuromuscular junctions. However,\nwhether NMJs are perturbed in the human disease is unknown. The best model for testing this before moving\nto patients is an hiPSC-derived nerve-muscle co-culture system where we can establish that motor neuron-\nmuscle connectivity is indeed perturbed and that treatment with integrated stress response inhibitors improves\nfunction. Establishing this would make ISR inhibitors more translational and increase interest in CMT from\ncompanies developing such drugs. These more sophisticate co-culture systems and particularly those for\nevaluating NMJ connectivity, are beyond the current expertise of the Burgess lab. We therefore propose this re-\ntraining supplement request to train Dr. Timothy Hines in these approaches. Dr. Hines is an accomplished senior\npostdoc who will transition to an Associate Research Scientist position at JAX to do this work. We have\nassembled a team of local and external mentors to train Dr. Hines in these methods. With these skills, Dr. Hines\nwill be well-positioned to find an independent position and secure NIH funding in the future. This supplement\nwill benefit Dr. Hines\u2019 professional development and the parent grant by making the experiments more\ntranslationally relevant.",

There is no approved treatment for any of the 100 genetic subtypes of CMT,\npresenting a large unmet clinical need. Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2D is caused by dominant mutations in glycyl\ntRNA synthetase (GARS), encoding the enzyme that charges glycine onto its cognate tRNAs during translation.\nOur working model for the disease mechanism is that the mutant enzyme binds its tRNA substrate, but does not\nrelease it to the ribosome, effectively sequestering the substrate. This results in ribosome stalling at glycine\ncodons and activation of the integrated stress response. Support for this mechanism comes from genetic studies\nin Drosophila and mouse models of CMT2D, in which transgenic overexpression of tRNAGlyGCC was able to\neffectively suppress the neuropathy phenotype. In preliminary studies, we have reproduced this result using\nAAV9 to deliver tRNAGly genes to three different CMT2D mouse models. Glycine has four codons (GGC, GGG,\nGGA, and GGU), and therefore four potential anticodons (GCC, CCC, UCC, and ACC respectively, though ACC\nis likely a nonfunctional tRNA). We made four AAV9 vectors expressing each tRNAGly anticodon driven by a\nPolIII U6 promoter. We found that GCC was highly effective, almost completely suppressing the neuropathy\nphenotype even in mice with a severe allele of Gars. Vectors expressing CCC and UCC were intermediate in\nefficacy, and ACC was ineffective (as anticipated). This profile of efficacy correlates with tRNA abundance and\ncodon usage, and suggests we are replacing the sequestered substrates of GARS with the AAVs. In the R61\nphase of this proposal we will optimize the vector payload (Aim 1) and capsid (Aim 2), and in the R33 phase\n(Aim 3), we will use this optimized vector in rigorous preclinical studies in mouse models of CMT2D. In Aim 1\n(R61), we will construct an AAV9 vector that carries all three effective tRNAGly genes (GCC, CCC, UCC) in a\nsingle vector. We will compare this against GCC alone, which was very effective. In Aim 2 (R61), we will\nrecreate the U6-GCC vector in a MACPNS capsid in an attempt to create a vector that is effective with systemic\ndelivery, rather than dosing directly into the nervous system. We will compare the MACPNS-GCC vector to\nAAV9-GCC. In Aim 3 (R33), we will test the optimized vector (GCC or combined tRNAGlys, AAV9 or MACPNS)\nin two mouse models of CMT2D. We will also allow treated mice to age to show the perdurance of the effect,\nand we will examine the effects of treating after the onset of neuropathy. The successful completion of these\naims will show the in vivo efficacy of an optimized gene therapy treatment for CMT2D in preclinical studies in\nmouse models. This will position us for further translational research and IND-enabling studies through\nmechanisms such as the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network for Biologicals.",

However, there are few options available for their treatment, and\nwithout pathomechanisms being sufficiently elucidated, one's ability to generate a rationale for interventions is\ngreatly limited. Our studies are expected to address this barrier by establishing new etiological factors and\nmolecular mechanisms of mammalian neurodegeneration. One such mechanism is Ribosome-associated\nQuality Control (RQC), that mediates the degradation of incomplete polypeptides produced by ribosomes that\nstall during translation. Key factors working in RQC are the Ltn1/Listerin E3 ubiquitin ligase and its partner,\nNEMF (Rqc2 in yeast). PI Joazeiro has previously found that Ltn1 mutation causes neurodegeneration in mice.\nPI Cox has more recently identified two independent mutations in mouse Nemf causing motor neuron disease\nand used this to knowledge to identify previously undiagnosed patients with a similar neuromuscular condition\nthat inherited causative mutations in the human NEMF gene. In several ways, Ltn1-ENU and Nemf-ENU mice\nphenocopy each other, thus strengthening the connection between RQC dysfunction and neurodegeneration.\nThe proposed studies are aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration\ncaused by NEMF loss of function. We focus our analyses on a recently-discovered activity of NEMF that is\nconserved from bacteria to humans\u2013the modification of aberrant nascent chains with C-terminal Alanine tails\nthat have a proteolytic function. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that NEMF-mediated Ala tailing\nprotects neurons against degeneration.

We seek to understand the biochemical and cellular basis for these diseases, to test mechanisms that could explain their specificity for motor and sensory neurons, and to test possible pharmacological and gene therapy-based treatments. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a collection of inherited diseases of the peripheral nervous system, and close to 100 genes are associated with CMT. The largest gene family associated with CMT is the tRNA synthetases. These enzymes charge amino acids onto their cognate tRNAs, and mutations in at least six cause peripheral neuropathy. Our preliminary data show that mutations in glycyl- and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Gars and Yars, respectively) in mouse models lead to the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) through the kinase GCN2. Genetic deletion of Gcn2 alleviates the phenotype of Gars/CMT2D mouse models. GCN2 is activated by uncharged tRNAs and also stalled ribosomes, and genetic interaction studies are consistent with ribosome stalling in vivo. Furthermore, uncharged tRNAs should be rescued by overexpression of wild-type synthetase, and we have shown this does not happen in Gars mouse models. Instead we favor a mechanism in which the tRNA substrate becomes limiting. We propose the following model: The mutant synthetases have aberrantly increased affinity for their cognate tRNAs, effectively sequestering them. This leads to ribosome stalling at the relevant codons during translation, which activates GCN2 and the ISR. The chronic activation of the ISR contributes to disease. We propose three aims to test this model. In Aim 1, we will directly measure the affinities of wild-type and mutant synthetases for their cognate tRNAs, anticipating that mutant synthetases will have higher affinities and slower off rates. We will also develop cell-based models using pluripotent human cell lines engineered to carry neuropathy-associated tRNA synthetase alleles. Differentiating these cells to motor neurons will validate our model in human cells and enable studies ribosome stalling and other relevant cell biology. We can also combine these systems predictively to create pathogenic or protective mutations, correlating tRNA affinity, ribosome stalling, induction of the ISR, and severity of neuropathy. In Aim 2, we will test possible mechanisms underlying the specificity of the disease. The tRNA synthetase genes are ubiquitously expressed, and the change in affinity should not be cell-type specific. Therefore, motor and sensory neurons may be particularly susceptible to ribosome stalling and the induction of the ISR, or may be particularly sensitive to tRNA sequestration due to high expression of the synthetase genes or poor expression of tRNAs. In Aim 3, we will test whether pharmacological inhibition of the ISR is beneficial, as suggested by our genetic studies with Gcn2 knockout mice. We will also test if the phenotype is rescued (which we anticipate) or exacerbated using AAV9 vectors to increase tRNA expression. These studies are potentially translational, and also directly test our proposed tRNA sequestration mechanism.",

The long-term goal is to increase the\ndiversity of next-generation scientists that can use cutting edge genetics and genomics techniques to study\naddiction. To achieve this goal, trainee recruitment efforts will target institutions serving significant\nunderrepresented minority (URM) populations and faculty who themselves are URM. This training program\nconsist of two components. To begin, participants will first complete a customized, virtual mentored course\ndesigned to deliver foundational skills and knowledge in mammalian and systems genetics of addiction. The\nvirtual course will combine newly-derived content combined with material derived from several of JAX's signature\ncourses including the McKusick Human and Mammalian Genetics Short Course, and the Short Course on the\nGenetics of Addiction, and from established JAX online educational modules including The Basics of Mouse\nGenetics, and Complex Traits. Then, a subset of course participants will be invited to return to JAX with 2 trainees\n(post-doctoral, graduate or undergraduate) for an extended summer research experience mentored by hosting\nJAX faculty. Faculty-trainee teams will be hosted at JAX by program mentors, where they will make use of JAXs\nadvanced research resources to learn techniques needed to augment their research into addiction related\nphenomena through the incorporation of mammalian genetics and genomics. They will return to their home\ninstitutions with knowledge, skills, data and resources to support follow-on research, presentations, publications\nand grant applications. This model will foster the career development of URM faculty as well as both the\nparticipating young scientist-trainees and the future trainees of the URM faculty member. The program is\ndesigned to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide foundational education in mammalian genetics and\nsystems genetics of addiction through virtual, mentored instruction. 2) Engage diverse faculty and student teams\nin summer mentored research projects utilizing advanced methods and resources for addiction genetics. 3)\nRecruit individuals from underrepresented minority groups to participate in the virtual course, mentored research\nexperiences, and career development skills training. Impact: Successful completion of these aims will result in\nan expanded number of addiction researchers from URM groups who are actively working with model organism\ngenetics and genomics to understand and characterize mechanisms of addiction related behavior. Educational\nmaterials will be made broadly available, and a select group of investigators will advance to develop specific\ngenetic and genomic research programs with support in the use of emerging technologies in these fields. The\neffectiveness of this novel program will be evaluated and if successful, may be used as a model for expanded\ndeployment in other research fields or institutions.",

The training program will immerse participants and faculty in a unique and highly integrated scientific environment and empower the next generation of scientists tackling human cancer. The integrated program will cover advances in three critical areas: experimental cancer models, modern technology to assess mechanisms and outcomes, and the interplay of the tumor and host genetics as well as tumor microenvironment and the immune system. It will teach classical approaches to mouse and human genetics, modern molecular genetic methodologies, computational and bioinformatics concepts, ontological standards, and scientific and medical ethics. Trainees will participate in lectures, workshops, multi-disciplinary scientific debates, networking and career development sessions, and poster sessions. They will receive practical training in bioinformatics, statistical genetics, and the use and analysis of PDX models. This course will take place at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), which hosts an NCI-designated Basic Laboratory Cancer Center and is a global resource of mouse models. The proposed 8-day intensive, immersion course focused on graduate students, postdocs, and new investigators will promote active interaction and networking between the participants as well as with the outstanding cadre of lecturers and trainers. Additionally, the Short Course will be delivered in a hybrid format, with online/virtual access to the seminars and, where practical and feasible, the workshops: this was successfully piloted in 2022. The hybrid format\u202fbroadens participation for scientists\u202fwho could not otherwise\u202fattend. Attendees will be actively recruited, scholarships will be provided to enable in-person attendance, and a virtual option will enable participation by those that are unable to travel. Emphasis will also be placed on best practices for cancer research to address ongoing health care disparities, the need for studies of genetically representative models, and representation of a breadth of human backgrounds within genetic databases and samples.\u00a0",

The long-term goal is to increase the\ndiversity of next-generation scientists that can use cutting edge genetics and genomics techniques to study\naddiction. To achieve this goal, trainee recruitment efforts will target institutions serving significant\nunderrepresented minority (URM) populations and faculty who themselves are URM. This training program\nconsist of two components. To begin, participants will first complete a customized, virtual mentored course\ndesigned to deliver foundational skills and knowledge in mammalian and systems genetics of addiction. The\nvirtual course will combine newly-derived content combined with material derived from several of JAX's signature\ncourses including the McKusick Human and Mammalian Genetics Short Course, and the Short Course on the\nGenetics of Addiction, and from established JAX online educational modules including The Basics of Mouse\nGenetics, and Complex Traits. Then, a subset of course participants will be invited to return to JAX with 2 trainees\n(post-doctoral, graduate or undergraduate) for an extended summer research experience mentored by hosting\nJAX faculty. Faculty-trainee teams will be hosted at JAX by program mentors, where they will make use of JAXs\nadvanced research resources to learn techniques needed to augment their research into addiction related\nphenomena through the incorporation of mammalian genetics and genomics. They will return to their home\ninstitutions with knowledge, skills, data and resources to support follow-on research, presentations, publications\nand grant applications. This model will foster the career development of URM faculty as well as both the\nparticipating young scientist-trainees and the future trainees of the URM faculty member. The program is\ndesigned to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide foundational education in mammalian genetics and\nsystems genetics of addiction through virtual, mentored instruction. 2) Engage diverse faculty and student teams\nin summer mentored research projects utilizing advanced methods and resources for addiction genetics. 3)\nRecruit individuals from underrepresented minority groups to participate in the virtual course, mentored research\nexperiences, and career development skills training. Impact: Successful completion of these aims will result in\nan expanded number of addiction researchers from URM groups who are actively working with model organism\ngenetics and genomics to understand and characterize mechanisms of addiction related behavior. Educational\nmaterials will be made broadly available, and a select group of investigators will advance to develop specific\ngenetic and genomic research programs with support in the use of emerging technologies in these fields. The\neffectiveness of this novel program will be evaluated and if successful, may be used as a model for expanded\ndeployment in other research fields or institutions.",

Drug addiction is a devastating and complex disorder influenced by multiple etiological factors. Extensive evidence demonstrates the role of genetic variation on a range of addiction behaviors, from experimentation and initiation of drug use to compulsive drug-taking behavior. Yet discovery of predisposing genes and variants in human populations is limited by high sample size requirements, phenotyping capacity, and variability in drug exposure and other environmental factors. Advanced mouse genetic populations exhibit variation in addiction-relevant behaviors and offer an experimental platform to discover the neurobiological mechanisms by which predisposing traits predict the tendency to self-administer cocaine. The CSNA employs the Collaborative Cross mouse genetic reference population and Diversity Outbred mouse mapping population across three integrated research projects focused on three interrelated aspects of addiction susceptibility: impulsivity, cocaine sensitization and self-administration. These traits are evaluated using a multidimensional phenotyping platform in a mouse population exhibiting extreme genetic and phenotypic variation, enabling a replicable and extensible assessment of the shared and distinct biological mechanisms of addiction vulnerability. These complementary populations are derived from the same founder strains, allowing for extensive data integration across studies within and outside the CSNA. The CSNA develops data integration methods and produces multiple functional genomics and phenomics datasets, deposited in widely accessed and highly functional informatics resources for the global research community. The Center also extends its results into basic neurobiological and preclinical therapeutic research by integrating findings with human genetic and genomic studies, generating novel, validated mouse mutants and identifying vulnerable and resistant strains for mechanistic studies. Three research support cores provide state-of-the-art approaches to the CSNA research projects and the larger research community, including a sophisticated, large-capacity Behavioral Phenotyping Core, an Integrative Genetics and Genomics Core for statistical genetics, molecular profiling, biobanking, data integration and data dissemination, and a Mouse Resource and Validation Core for creating and delivering novel mouse resources for systems genetics, validation, and disease modeling. The Administrative Core coordinates, integrates, and disseminates research, education and outreach activities. Through its combined efforts, the CSNA will have a lasting impact on the study of addiction genetics through the holistic examination of biobehavioral risk, the generation of community data resources that we and others will expand and exploit in future studies, and through education and training.",

Addiction remains a substantial worldwide social and economic burden despite\nextensive efforts to curb drug availability and use. The high heritability of cocaine addiction, indicates that the\npropensity to develop a substance use disorder (SUD) after drug exposure is genetically influenced. Both\nhuman and animal studies indicate that behavioral traits such as novelty seeking are strongly correlated with\nthe propensity to develop an SUD, but the biological basis of this relationship is unknown. We identify and\ncharacterize biological mechanisms of addiction and predisposing behavior by harnessing advances in mouse\ngenetic resources, including the high-precision Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population, validation in\ngenetically modified mice, gene expression quantitation through RNA sequence analysis, and computational\nand statistical methods in systems genetics. In Aim 1 we will identify genetic mechanisms underlying\npredisposing novelty-related traits and drug self-administration through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in\na large set of DO mice. The most compelling and tractable of these will be validated in gene targeted mouse\nmodels. The intravenous drug-self administration (IVSA) paradigm, considered the gold standard for the\nassessment of addiction traits in rodent research, will enable quantification of the core features of addiction\nincluding initiation of drug use, poor extinction and enhanced reinstatement of reinforced drug taking. In Aim 2\nwe will quantify gene expression genetic variation in two connected addiction relevant tissues, the prefrontal\ncortex and striatum, map expression QTLs and identify genetic correlates of predisposing behavior using RNA-\nseq in a drug-na\u00efve subset of DO mice, and disseminate these results through widely used informatics\nresources. Gene expression analysis in drug-na\u00efve mice enables separation of the biological substrates of\npredisposition to addiction from the biological sequelae of drug exposure. In Aim 3, we will address the\nfundamental problem of evaluating coordinated gene expression across multiple components of the addiction\ncircuitry to assess relative dysregulation toward the identification of global- vs brain region-specific factors in\naddiction vulnerability. This will be accomplished through the development of robust multivariate statistical\nmethods for identification of relations across multiple high dimensional data sets. This strategy will make\ncontinued use of a common collection of phenotypes to relate disparate and incompatible measures across\ntwo independent sets of mice, while extending into multiple tissue co-expression networks. Development of this\ntechnique in the context of addiction research will extend a unifying data integration framework to\nmultidimensional to human and mouse genetic and genomic studies for all disease areas. Synergy among the\naims will reveal networks from polymorphism to addiction-related behavior.",

This proposed program will function as a defined cohort within the existing JAX Summer Student Program (SSP). Under the larger umbrella of the JAX NCI-designated Cancer Center, JAX-GM constitutes a uniquely collaborative, highly innovative research environment that brings together scientists with diverse cancer expertise. The Specific Aims of our program are as follows: (1) Provide an authentic and mentored research experience. JAX-GM will recruit 10 students to join the laboratory of a program faculty mentor in a cutting-edge, collaborative research environment where they will use molecular and computational methods to investigate the etiology and evolution of human breast, ovarian, bone, and brain cancers, leukemia, cancer immunotherapy, and genome structural variation and instability. (2) Recruit students from across the country to experience cancer research training in the unique context of a biomedical research institution. The participants will be actively recruited through national outreach and chosen through a competitive application process. The program will admit undergraduates from varying academic institutions - from large research-intensive universities to primarily undergraduate institutions. Participation from across the country will be facilitated by the provision of each intern with a full fellowship, including subsistence, travel, research supplies, and funds to offset the cost of housing. These funds will also enable economically disadvantaged students to forgo summer jobs and participate in this life-changing educational experience. (3) Encourage careers in science and lifelong scientific literacy.

By applying agent combinations against patient-derived\nmodels, it is possible to obtain evidence to determine the most promising combinations for advancement to\nclinical testing in defined sub-populations of cancer patients. However, integration of PDX drug response with\nmolecular characterization data across diverse PDX collections is needed to enable this vision. A key aspect is\nthe need for well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of standardized datasets\nfrom PDXs and other patient-derived models. The Jackson Laboratory-Seven Bridges (JAX-SB) PDX Data\nCommons and Coordination Center (PDCCC) has addressed this challenge for the last 5 years, uniting the\nefforts of the data-generating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI\u2019s\nPatient-Derived Model Repository/PDMR) components of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research\nNetwork (PDXNet) into a cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic\napproaches, our PDCCC provides administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX\nmethod standardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. To date, we have built\nthe PDXNet Portal, which currently contains PDXNet model information and data resources from 334 new\nmodels across 33 cancer types. Our PDCCC team has both facilitated and actively guided consortium\ncollaborative projects, leading to several major publications and 10 Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Letters\nof Intent. Here, we propose to enhance the PDXNet Portal and refine our organizational activities to address\nneeds clarified by the NCI and PDX communities, including: faster translation of PDX studies to clinical trials;\nprecise organization and sharing of multi-omic and treatment response data; and development of predictors of\nclinical treatment response. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To provide robust PDCCC support for PDXNet\nstakeholders through regular committees, personnel expertise, and project tools; 2) To enhance PDXNet Portal\ncontent, functionality, and data sharing; and 3) To develop and implement strategies that accelerate PDX\ntranslation to clinical trials. Through these Aims, we will coordinate the activities of the PDXNet to increase the\nvalue of patient-derived cancer model treatment studies and speed the generation of clinical trials.",

Spatial transcriptomic approaches are revolutionizing our understanding of cancer\ninitiation, progression, and drug resistance by revealing expression patterns with tissue morphological context.\nHowever, these approaches have not yet been applied to the interdisciplinary biology of aging-driven cancers,\ndespite the likelihood that intratissue and microenvironmental evolution mediate the aging phenotype. Moreover,\nthe majority of current single cell spatial projects are based on 3' short read RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and\ntherefore lack the ability to detect full-length spliced isoforms, which are frequently observed in tumors and are\nknown to impact tumor initiation and treatment response. Work from us and others has revealed widespread\nalterations in alternative RNA splicing in human tumors, including in breast cancer, and that half of all spliced\nisoforms detected in human breast tumors using long-read sequencing (LR-seq) are missed by RNA-seq and\nabsent from reference transcriptomes. In addition, we have causally linked the upregulation of specific splicing\nfactors with breast tumor initiation both in vitro and in vivo and identified age-dependent changes in spliced\nisoforms in cancer-associated genes in mammary epithelial cells. Together, these results suggest that alternative\nsplicing is a critical mechanism underlying tumor initiation with age, and that spatial LR-seq approaches are\nrequired to resolve these mechanisms. However, standardized approaches and resources to measure, quantify,\nand visualize expression of full-length isoforms within tissues are lacking. This gap in infrastructure impedes the\nfield's ability to identify cell populations that express age-dependent isoforms, how such isoforms impact cancer\ninitiation for example through changes in receptor-ligand interactions. To address these infrastructure and\nknowledge gaps, we will first develop approaches to map and analyze full-length RNA isoforms spatially\nwithin tissue sections (R21 phase, Aim 1). These tools, which merge LR-seq and spatial transcriptomics, will\nbe applicable across sample types and will therefore be of broad, sustainable utility to the research community.\nWe will then apply these technologies to generate a spatial map of full-length RNA isoforms in healthy\nbreast tissues and tumors during aging (R33 phase, Aims 2 and 3). Finally, we will develop data sharing\nand visualization tools for spatial isoform expression to enable others to mine our data via a web resource\n(R33 phase, Aim 4). To achieve these goals, this project will leverage the complementary and interdisciplinary\nexpertise of the Anczukow lab in alternative splicing and breast cancer, and of the Chuang lab in systems biology\nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. In response to NOT-CA-22-002, Notice of NCI's Participation in PAR-20-\n070, this project will deliver a spatial transcriptomic infrastructure for isoform profiling and a critical\ninterdisciplinary data resource for aging and cancer researchers to understand the role of splicing in tissue aging\nand oncogenesis, thereby advancing approaches for cancer early detection, intervention, and prevention.",

In response to this ongoing need, The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), in\npartnership with Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU), proposes a curriculum development\ninitiative, Genomics in Action, for community college students that will impart content knowledge and skills in\ngenetics and genomics to better prepare them for a variety of careers, such as laboratory, medical and nursing\nassistants. Community college students within the CSCU system are a highly diverse group, with approximately\n50% of students receiving financial assistance and 50% of students from minoritized populations. To achieve\nour objective, we propose the following Aims: 1. Develop 15 virtual modules on key topics in human\ngenomics, tailored to community college student needs. These modules will address curricular gaps as\nidentified through needs analysis with our CSCU faculty. Our innovative approach will utilize short video content\nto introduce topics, demonstrate concepts, as well as provide context for each topic within a career or job in the\ngenomics workforce. Each module will feature a near-peer who is employed in a role for which community college\nstudents are training. The modules will thus be designed to connect the genomics content and skills directly to\napplication in the workplace. 2. Disseminate fully digital modules to the broader community. Our team will\ndesign modules that can be seamlessly integrated into our CSCU partner institutions learning management\nsystems, and professional development workshops will be provided to facilitate adoption the Genomics in Action\nmodules among the broader CSCU community. We will also expand dissemination through JAX\u2019s online and\ndigital education program that provides free access to our interactive multimedia educational content, making\nthe modules available for use globally. To evaluate the impact of the Genomics in Action modules, pilot adoption\nwill take place during year 1 of the project and surveys will be administered to assess the effectiveness of the\nmodule delivery and usability by both faculty and students. Modules will be adapted, refined, and subsequently\ndelivered in courses again in years 2 and 3.

Biological aging\u2014in contrast to chronological\naging\u2014occurs at different rates for different individuals. In humans, growing old comes with increased health\nissues and mortality rates, yet some individuals live long and healthy lives, and others succumb earlier to\ndiseases and disorders. The concept of frailty is used to quantify this heterogeneity and is de\ufb01ned as the state\nof increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. The frailty index (FI) is an invaluable and widely used tool\nwhich outperforms other methods to quantify frailty. FIs have been adapted for use in mice using a variety of\nboth behavioral and physiological measures as index items. However, because conducting mouse FI requires\ntrained individuals for manual scoring, it often limits the scalability of the tool. Thus, although the FI is an\nextremely useful tool for aging research, an increase in its scalability, reliability, and reproducibility through\nautomation would enhance its utility. We used machine learning applied to video data to create an automated\nvisual FI (vFI). The is easy to implement, unbiased, and scalable. Here we propose to improve our tool and carry\nout an interventional study. We will adopt the vFI to function with genetically diverse mice (R61: Aim 1). We will\nalso create features from long-term monitoring to increase accuracy and breadth of systems measured in the\nvFI (R61: Aim 2). Finally, we will apply the vFI to a diet intervention study to show its utility for large scale studies\n(R33: Aim 3). We will test a high fat high sugar diet (increased frailty) and caloric restriction group (decreased\nfrailty) with normal chow (control) in a Diversity Outbred population of mice. The result of this project will be a\nfully validated and automated vFI that can be used for high-throughput interventional studies, enabling\ntherapeutics for healthy aging.",

However, quantitative behavior analysis has dramatically accelerated and improved with the implementation and application of new machine learning methods, including new deep learning-based methods to track animals at high temporal and spatial resolution. This technology has broad current and potential application that will impact a breadth of fields that have direct relevance and impact on studies of human health and disease, including the fields of neuroscience, behavior, genetics, psychiatry, and biomedicine. However, several roadblocks limit the widespread adoption of these tools and analyses. First, many tracking and behavior analysis packages require a high level of computational expertise and are thus limited in application to expert labs. Second, with high-resolution data streams, quantitating behavior requires new statistical tools and proper modeling of data. Since the application of machine learning to behavioral analyses is an emerging and key methodology, we recognize an unmet need for investigators in a variety of relevant fields to learn the fundamentals of its rigorous use. Thus, to train a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of neuroscience, machine learning, and behavior, we propose to establish an annual 4-day workshop that brings together experts in quantitative behavior, computer vision, and experimental design to provide a practical introduction to the field of quantitative neuroethology and behavior: we propose the unique and timely interdisciplinary course The Short Course on the Application of Machine Learning for Automated Quantification of Behavior at the Jackson Laboratory (JAX). This Short Course will provide attendees (in-person and virtually) with; information on the state-of-the-art of machine learning based behavior quantitation, the fundamentals of behavior quantitation, hands-on workshops and data analysis, a forum for student-teacher interaction for networking, and training at the leading edge of computational ethology. Students will emerge from the course with the ability to: 1) design a high quality, adequately powered behavior experiment; 2) select and install a suitable platform for high-resolution analysis of animal behavior; 3) deploy a behavior data analysis strategy, including collecting new training datasets, training analysis software, and validating performance on held-out data; and 4) run workflows/pipelines that are necessary to analyze their data following extraction. To achieve this, we propose: Aim 1. To develop and deliver a 4-day workshop to train scientists on application of machine learning to animal behavior quantitation. Aim 2. To create an environment that will expand the field of quantitative behavior analysis by fostering idea generation, discussion, and collaboration to yield new discoveries, broader applications, and advance technology development. Aim 3. Foster the recruitment and development of junior investigators in neuroscience, behavioral genetics, and quantitative analysis of animal behavior.",

Lack of\nexposure to scientific research resources and mentors, economic factors, and cultural biases are barriers that\nlimit access to quality science education and, in turn, hinder the expansion of our nation's research capacity by\nlimiting contributions from a deep pool of intellectual talent.\nThe program will benefit from JAX's nine decades of success in training scientists at all career stages, including\nthose from underrepresented groups, by its world-leading mouse genetic, genomic, and computational\nresources, and by its well-funded and productive faculty. The program will build upon programmatic infrastructure\nfor career development and a community of post-bacc peers from an existing post-bacc program at JAX. The\ngenomics DAP will be distinct from the existing post-bacc program as the focus for the proposed program will\nbe specifically on career development for basic research in the areas of genomics, genome technology, and data\nscience.\nThe program will host up to six post-baccalaureate fellows in a year with individuals distributed across the Bar\nHarbor, Maine and Farmington, Connecticut JAX campuses. The three primary aims for the program will be (1)\nProvide two-year mentored post-baccalaureate research experiences in genomics, genome technologies, and\ndata science for individuals from underrepresented minority groups; (2) Implement a curriculum that provides\nknowledge, skills, and training complementary to the mentored laboratory research experience and, (3)\nIncorporate formal and informal evaluation methods to strengthen the training program. Oversight for the\nprogram will be provided by two PIs, one from each campus, and by Program Staff from the JAX Genomic\nEducation team. An Advisory Council comprised of internal and external individuals will evaluate the program's\neffectiveness and provide guidance on sustaining a research workplace that is inclusive and equitable.\nThe alumni from the post-bacc program will contribute to building a research workforce that is representative of\nour nation's population.

Mouse models have provided key insights into cancer susceptibility, the molecular genetics of\ntumor suppressor and oncogenes, and therapy response in pre-clinical and co-clinical studies. Human tumors\nengrafted into immune compromised and humanized mice (aka, Patient Derived Xenografts) are playing an\nincreasingly important role as a powerful preclinical platform for testing new cancer treatments.\nThe Mouse Models of Human Cancer (MMHC) database is a unique on-line compendium of mouse models for\nhuman cancer. MMHCdb provides electronic access to expertly curated and harmonized information on\ndiverse mouse models for human cancer along with tools for accessing and visualizing associated data from\nthese models. This in turn, facilitates the selection of appropriate strains of mice for cancer genetics research.\nMMHCdb integrates data derived from peer-reviewed literature and from direct submissions from researchers.\nData in MMHCdb are also obtained from other bioinformatics resources including PathBase, HUGO Human\nGene Nomenclature database, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress.\nIn this proposal we describe our plans for the continued development of MMHCdb with an emphasis on\nexpanded support for analysis of tumor genomic data and drug response data from Patient Derived Xenograft\nmodels. To accomplish these goals we will build on successful collaborations to develop data standards for\nPDX models that are now widely adopted. The major goals for the project renewal include the following:\n\u00b7 continue to populate MMHCdb with data on strain-specific patterns of tumorigenesis in inbred, mutant, and\n genetically engineered mice,\n\u00b7 leverage collaborations with Seven Bridges and PDXNet to analyze genomic data for PDX models using a\n common analysis pipeline,\n\u00b7 develop a platform for the analysis of PDX genomic and drug response data, and\n\u00b7 support the infrastructure of MMHCdb and our user community through ongoing database maintenance,\n development of new software components, user support services, and community outreach activities.",

To coordinate the activities of the new Ped-In Vivo-TP initiative, we have assembled a team of\ninvestigators from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and Seven Bridges Genomics (SB) with unique combined\nexpertise and experience with in vivo cancer models, scalable cloud-based data management and analysis\nsystems, informatics resource development, and multi-site project coordination. Combining the complementary\nstrengths of JAX and SB provides the ideal foundation for a coordinating center to maximize the short- and\nlong-term impacts of the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program for advancing the application of precision medicine\nin pediatric oncology. We will manage a comprehensive and cohesive testing program to advance precision\nmedicine in pediatric oncology through effective public-private partnerships among pharmaceutical companies,\nregulatory agencies, funders, and research organizations. We will achieve this goal through the following aims:\nAim 1: Establish and maintain the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Coordinating Center (PIVOT CC) to provide\nadministrative and logistical support for diverse stakeholders in the Pediatric in Vivo Testing Program\nconsortium. We will draw on our team's combined decades of experience with multi-site program\nmanagement, cancer model development, standardized testing of in vivo cancer models, data management\nand analysis, and informatics resource development to ensure timely decision making, conformance to\nstandard protocols, resource tracking, and effective communications within the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Aim 2:\nProvide data management, statistical, and bioinformatics support to ensure data security and integrity.\nWe will leverage existing protocols and software systems at JAX and SB to identify relevant in vivo cancer\nmodels and to collect, analyze, and securely manage data generated from testing centers within the\nconsortium. We will perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses on consortium data to reliably inform the\nevaluation of the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in a pediatric oncology setting. We will develop a public-\nfacing data portal for sharing of data and methods with the broader scientific community. Aim 3: Provide\nscientific coordination to maintain an efficient and effective preclinical testing pipeline. We will draw\nfrom the extensive experience of our team with in vivo pharmacology and coordination of similar consortia to\nmanage and coordinate the testing of agents by the Ped-In Vivo-TP centers at all stages of the process, from\nthe identification of relevant in vivo models to the generation of final technical reports and publication of results.\nWe will develop, record, and track performance metrics for the consortium to inform the evaluation of the\nprogram's success and impact.",

The training program will immerse participants and faculty in a unique and highly integrated scientific environment and empower the next generation of scientists tackling human cancer. The integrated program will cover advances in three critical areas: experimental cancer models, modern technology to assess mechanisms and outcomes, and the interplay of the tumor and host genetics as well as tumor microenvironment and the immune system. It will teach classical approaches to mouse and human genetics, modern molecular genetic methodologies, computational and bioinformatics concepts, ontological standards, and scientific and medical ethics. Trainees will participate in lectures, workshops, multi-disciplinary scientific debates, networking and career development sessions, and poster sessions. They will receive practical training in bioinformatics, statistical genetics, and the use and analysis of PDX models. This course will take place at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), which hosts an NCI-designated Basic Laboratory Cancer Center and is a global resource of mouse models. The proposed 8-day intensive, immersion course focused on graduate students, postdocs, and new investigators will promote active interaction and networking between the participants as well as with the outstanding cadre of lecturers and trainers. Additionally, the Short Course will be delivered in a hybrid format, with online/virtual access to the seminars and, where practical and feasible, the workshops: this was successfully piloted in 2022. The hybrid format\u202fbroadens participation for scientists\u202fwho could not otherwise\u202fattend. Attendees will be actively recruited, scholarships will be provided to enable in-person attendance, and a virtual option will enable participation by those that are unable to travel. Emphasis will also be placed on best practices for cancer research to address ongoing health care disparities, the need for studies of genetically representative models, and representation of a breadth of human backgrounds within genetic databases and samples.\u00a0",

However, specialized skills and training are needed to effectively access, integrate, and\ninterpret them. This project will address a shortage of these skills, by providing training and exposing students\nto examples of successful reuse of large-scale data. To equip researchers with the necessary technical, scientific,\nand implementation-related skills, we propose the Short Course on Methods for MultiOmics Data Analysis at the\nJackson Laboratory (JAX). This week-long course will focus on developing conceptual knowledge and practical\nanalytical techniques centered around rigorous analysis of Common Fund datasets. Our course will also focus\non building the soft skills needed to work effectively in collaborative research teams. Experts from Common Fund\nprojects including SenNet, KOMP2, GTEx, and the Metabolomics Workbench will serve as instructors and\nmentors in the course. Our goal is to build an educational program that cultivates rigorous, reproducible practices\nin managing and analyzing large-scale molecular data from the Common Fund while fostering effective,\nproductive research teams and long-term collaborations. Achieving these goals will strengthen scientific rigor\nand broaden the impact of Common Fund data sets.",

Immunology is of great importance to cardiovascular research since inflammation and fibrosis are indicators of both heart failure progression and myocardial remodeling, topics at the core of NHLBI\u2019s research mission. The involvement of the immune system in health and disease is currently an area of intense interest in the field, requiring innovative, interdisciplinary research to realize the potential for transforming the landscape of cardiovascular medicine. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and improving our understanding of the role of inflammation in heart disease will improve patient outcomes.\nWe hosted a highly successful inaugural conference on the topic of Immuno-cardiology in September 2023 that featured recent advances in the basic science and clinical relevance of dysregulated immune activation and fibrosis in response to cardiac injury, presented by an unprecedented cross-section of established and emerging leaders in their areas of expertise. The conference attracted a capacity audience of over 100 participants. Our long-term goal is to facilitate collaborations and growth in this important field.\nSpecific Aims of the symposium: 1) Build on the momentum of the 2023 Symposium, bringing together various expertise in the field to continue exploration of synergies and opportunities for cross-fertilization and translation in this fast-moving field; 2) Integrate findings from related organ systems (kidney, lung and liver); 3) Foster relationships to encourage new collaborations; 4) Attract interest and participation from the next generation of scientists who will transform this interdisciplinary field. \nThe meeting is unique in that it will bring together academic, clinical and pharmaceutical-based scientists, include researchers looking at relevant organ systems other than the heart, and showcase the work of young investigators. NIH support for the symposium will specifically provide travel funding to promote participation by early career scientists, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.",

We\nhave incorporated known senescence inducers (e.g. Doxorubicin, Palbociclib, high fat diet) in the mouse model\nand shared relevant tissues (lung, muscle, ovary) with other SenNet TMCs for analysis. In the parent grant to\nthis supplement, we have established The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Cellular Senescence Network Tissue\nMapping Center (JAX-Sen TMC) focused on the analysis of mouse tissue to address a significant research and\nclinical need for improved biomarkers and cellular maps of senescence. Advances in our understanding of\nbiological aging and the recognition of aging as a modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases and geriatric\nsyndromes are fueling a growing interest in the cellular underpinnings of the aging process. Despite recent\nprogress in cellular senescence research and the discovery of new senolytics and senomorphics, we lack clear\ninformation regarding the role of cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease, and the effect of genetic\nvariation on these phenomena. In the JAX-Sen TMC we are mapping senescent cells in the context of multiple\nage-matched tissues of genetically defined mouse cohorts, raised in standardized environments throughout their\nlifespan and defining senescent cell phenotypes associated to features of genetics, age and senolytic\ninterventions. The tissues of specific focus within the JAX-Sen TMC are kidney, pancreas, heart, and placenta.\nThis supplement aims to generate detailed tissue mapping data on the mouse pancreas and kidney derived from\nour senescence inducers study and perform the analysis of this data using our existing framework. Specifically,\nwe will employ bulk RNA-seq, H&E, CODEX multiplexed antibody imaging, and Xenium in situ RNA spatial\nprofiling. Senescent cells identified from the senescent inducers experiment will be directly compared to those\nfrom natural aging, and provide the foundation for future senolytic/senomorphic functional studies.",

JAX-Sen is organized around three cores nested in the well-resourced\nenvironment for aging research and multi-omics profiling at JAX. JAX-Sen will profile senescent cells in kidney,\nadipose tissue, placenta, pancreas, heart, and hypothalamus, selected for their clinical relevance to chronic\ndiseases of aging, the domain expertise of the JAX-Sen leadership team in the biology of these tissues, and the\noverlap of four of the tissues with KAPP-Sen. We will leverage cutting-edge mouse resources including the\nDiversity Outbred, which offers unparalleled genetic diversity for modelling a range of molecular senescence\nphenotypes, and new inbred (C57BL/6J) transgenic mice that express p16 and p21 driven fluorescent tags to\nallow visualization enrichment for specific senescent cell subsets. The Biological Analysis Core will apply a\nmultitude of analytical modalities to selected tissues (bulk and single cell and single nucleus RNAseq, Visium\nspatial transcriptomics, multiplexed antibody-based imaging, multiplexFISH, imaging mass spectrometry\nincluding lipidomics, metabolomics, proteomics, 3D tissue reconstruction from serial sections), and will re-\nevaluate these technologies throughout the project period to ensure our approaches align with those of other\ncenters and that we maximally benefit from the technology development efforts in SenNet. These profiling\nactivities will yield subcellular resolution of biomolecular content in senescent cells not possible with human\nsamples, along with an expanded set of senescent cell biomarkers. The Data Analysis Core will combine robust\ncomputational capability with scalable and reproducible scientific workflows to develop and implement Network-\nwide open data and metadata standards. The Data Analysis Core will benefit from JAX\u2019s unique mouse research\nresources to establish the diversity of senescence by integrating with expression quantitative trait locus and\nprotein quantitative trait locus data in DO mice and JAX bioinformatics resources, e.g., Mouse Genome\nInformatics, Mouse Phenome Database, Monarch Initiative. The integrative mining of JAX-Sen data will lead to\nnovel methods for multi-modal 3D map reconstruction from imaging data and will yield an important resource for\nSenNet interpretation and enrichment of human senescent cell data. Finally, the Administrative Core will provide\nstrong oversight of project progress and nurture a culture of collaborative, dynamic scientific exchange within\nJAX-Sen. It will also maximize JAX-Sen\u2019s engagement in the consortium through collaborative activities that will\nhelp optimize data generation activities and create new research synergies. In so doing, JAX-Sen will help\nachieve the goal of SenNet to generate a unprecedented atlas of mouse senescent cells and new biomarkers of\nsenescence for human analysis and therapeutic application.",

Knowledge of the intensity, frequency, distribution, and genetic\nregulation of these elemental evolutionary processes is therefore essential for understanding the evolutionary\norigins of disease-associated variation and predicting the evolutionary fate of genomes. This research program\nwill unlock new basic biological understanding into the evolutionary mechanisms that give rise to genomic\nvariation, with a particular focus on repeat-rich genomic loci. Our work will draw on the strengths of the mouse\nmodel system, including its translational relevance to humans, genetically diverse inbred and outbred strain\nresources, large whole genome sequence datasets from pedigreed populations, tools for functional discovery,\nand museum-archived samples for wild-caught mice. The proposed program is organized into three major\nresearch areas. The first research focus will pursue in-depth investigations of repeat-rich functional chromatin\ndomains responsible for chromosome segregation, genome stability, and fertility. Using state-of-the-art long-\nread sequencing methods, we will generate high-quality de novo assemblies for diverse inbred mouse strains\nand pursue focused comparative genomic studies of two highly repetitive genomic loci: the Y chromosome and\ncentromeres. We will complement these genomic investigations with hypothesis-driven studies to assess the\nfunctional consequences of diversity at these loci for male fertility and the fidelity of chromosome segregation,\nrespectively. Second, we will retroactively mine laboratory mouse reference mapping populations as controlled\nevolution experiments. By monitoring the flow of genetic information over multiple generations, we aim to\ncharacterize variation in germline mutation rates, map mutation rate modifiers, and identify phenotypic correlates\nof mutation rate heterogeneity. Third, we will lead the development and analysis of a large-scale whole genome\nsequence resource comprised of ~1000 wild mouse genomes. Recognizing that deleterious variants are\nmaintained at low frequency in the wild by the action of natural selection, we will identify variants in inbred mouse\nstrains that are individually rare in wild mouse populations, and use allele frequencies in wild mice as a criterion\nfor prioritizing likely deleterious causal alleles within legacy mouse QTL mapping datasets. Together, these\ninvestigations will make substantial inroads to our understanding of the mechanisms of genome diversity at\nstructurally complex functional chromatin domains and the genetic and environmental controls on mutation rate.\nIn addition, this program will create a new genome sequence resource that will empower biomedical and basic\ndiscovery in the mouse model system and solidify the PI\u2019s leadership in the mouse genomics community.\nCrucially, the proposed program will also create meaningful hands-on research training opportunities in\npopulation and evolutionary genomics, computational biology, and mouse genetics at the undergraduate,\npostbaccalaureate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.",

While the absence of genetic\ndiversity is a widely perceived strength of inbred strains, it is also a critical limitation, as a single inbred genetic\nbackground cannot capture the full spectrum of phenotypic responses observed in genetically diverse human\npopulations. This limits the translation success from inbred mouse models to human clinical outcomes and\nunderscores the need for mouse platforms that more accurately model human genetic variation. The Diversity\nOutbred (DO) mouse population was founded in 2012 to meet these crucial research needs. The DO was initiated\nfrom eight genetically diverse inbred mouse strains, including wild-derived representatives from each of three\ncardinal house mouse subspecies, and has been maintained by pseudo-random mating for over 50 generations.\nHowever, the inclusion of founder strains derived from reproductively isolated subspecies has, over time,\nexposed genetic incompatibilities and unchecked selfish elements, resulting in allele frequency distortions that\nhave compromised the genetic integrity of the DO. Here, we propose to generate a new, high diversity outbred\nmouse population, the Wild Mouse Diversity Panel (WMDP), founded from novel wild-derived inbred strains of\nsingle subspecies origin (Mus musculus domesticus). Our recent work has shown that a large proportion of\nvariants in the genomes of these newly developed M. m. domesticus strains are absent from existing inbred\nmouse strains, and that these strains capture novel neurobehavioral, metabolic, physiological, and biochemical\nphenotypes not observed in common laboratory mouse models. Thus, the WMDP stands to minimize potential\nhaplotype distortion due to genetic incompatibilities between subspecies, allow functional assessment of millions\nof variants that have never been tested in the laboratory, and empower investigations of natural genome\ncomplexity. In Aim 1, we will initiate an outbred population from four phenotypically and genetically diverse wild-\nderived M. m. domesticus inbred strains, implementing routine genomic monitoring of allele frequencies to\nensure the genetic integrity and longevity of the WMDP resource. To aid discovery efforts in this new population,\nwe will generate key genomic resources for the founder strains in Aim 2, including high quality de novo genome\nassemblies, comprehensive variant call sets, and a gene expression atlas of several tissues. In Aim 3, we will\nprovide a proof-of-principle study to underscore the power and utility of the WMDP. We will profile phenotypic\ndiversity for several morphological, metabolic, behavioral, and clinical traits in early outbreeding generations of\nthe WMDP, map causal loci, and integrate our findings with human data to identify human-mouse translational\nparallels at the levels of both genes and gene networks. This project will yield a new outbred mouse population\npoised for near limitless discovery in all areas of basic and preclinical research. This resource will become part\nof the Special Mouse Strain Resource at The Jackson Laboratory, which will provide the framework and setting\nfor its long-term maintenance and distribution to the global research community.",

These research efforts have produced significant insight into biology and disease, and yet there are many opportunities to accelerate innovation, development, and early dissemination of genomic technologies. The goal of the Technology Development Coordinating Center (TDCC) is to maximize these opportunities by promoting interaction among grantees, supporting innovative new ideas through pilot funding, and aiding in the dissemination of research results and new technologies to the broader scientific community. The TDCC will focus on three primary areas, aligned with these goals: 1) Support information exchange across the GTP leading to cross-fertilization of ideas. We will build on established Scientific Working Groups (SWG) that provide a venue for discussion of work in progress and collaboration on areas of shared interested and by hosting the annual program meeting Advances in Genomic Technology Development (AGTD). We will also work with the Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS) each year to host the annual CEGS program meeting, providing logistical support and programmatic continuity, while encouraging evolution of the format based on the location and host priorities. We will use the SWGs to identify gaps in the field that will provide the foundation for solicitation of Opportunity Funds. 2) Establish and manage an Opportunity Funds program to support initial development of promising new technologies and ideas or to enhance dissemination of new technologies. Peer review will be conducted by an External Review Panel of experts representing the breadth of fields of the GTP. 3) Implement outreach activities to improve awareness of GTP successes and facilitate access to GTP research by the broader scientific community. Outreach activities will be a combination of online/webinar format, focused video productions, and in-person meetings that incorporate interactive components. We will incorporate input on content and format from other NIH programs. A concerted effort will be made to promote TDCC outreach activities to a broad group of researchers who may benefit from information about new technologies from the GTP and their applications. The annual and SWG meetings will provide opportunities for trainee engagement and contribution. Leveraging the experience of the large number of SBIR award recipients who are TDCC participants, we will focus on issues related to commercialization of new technologies providing researchers with information and perspective on how to expand access to new methods beyond the developers\u2019 labs. The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) is well qualified to serve as the TDCC, bringing together broad expertise in genomics, extensive experience in consortium management and conference development, and established relationships with NHGRI grantees.",

The\nproposed research in this K99/R00 application aims to identify novel pathways involved in the control of renal\noxidative stress with translational applicability on halting CKD progression and improving patient outcomes.\nCandidate: Dr. Agoro completed a PhD in Immunology at Orl\u00e9ans University (France) followed with a fellowship\nat NYU before joining Dr. White\u2019s lab at Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) as a postdoctoral fellow.\nDr. Agoro\u2019s previous work identified iron metabolism and inflammatory mechanisms involved in tuberculosis,\nasthma, and CKD pathogeneses giving him the strong background knowledge required to conduct the proposed\nresearch. In addition, Dr. Agoro outlined a career development roadmap in building skills in bioinformatics during\nthe K99 phase with a vision of leveraging novel technologies to understand the pathogenesis of CKD as an\nindependent investigator. Dr. Agoro proposes four career goals during the K99/training phase: 1) To master the\nscATACseq analytic pipelines; 2) To generate conditional mouse models; 3) To successfully find a faculty\nposition and 4) To develop leadership and professional skills in communication. Further Dr. Agoro will undergo\ntraining activities that include didactic and experiential learning to enable him to gain the necessary skills for\ngenomic data analyses. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Agoro and his primary mentor, Dr. White, PhD, have\nassembled a strong team formed with a co-mentor, collaborators, advisor, and consultant to assist Dr. Agoro\nthrough the proposed training, research activities, and faculty job search. The proposed career development\nplan will utilize the intellectual and bioinformatics resources at IUSM. In addition, Dr. Agoro will attend national\nmeetings, as well as seminars/courses and workshops locally. Research: CKD is an important public health\nepidemic affecting approximately 37 million Americans. CKD disease progression is associated with a graded\nincrease in oxidative stress driving highly adverse complications. This proposal will decipher novel pathways\ninvolved in renal stress control via the following specific aims: Aim 1 will identify the mechanisms by which\nKlotho-dependent FGF23 signaling regulates HMOX1. In Aim 2, Dr. Agoro will test the role of Klotho and Hmox1\nin CKD pathogenesis with a specific focus on renal oxidative stress, iron metabolism and mitochondria function.\nSummary: The proposed research will profile the genome-wide chromatin accessibility of renal proximal tubule\nin Klotho-transgenic vs WT mice and study the effects of Klotho-dependent FGF23 signaling on Nrf2 binding to\nARE elements. Dr. Agoro will also determine the role of the FGF23-Klotho-Hmox1 axis on renal oxidative stress\nduring CKD. In sum, this comprehensive plan will provide Dr. Agoro with the training needed to conduct\nindependent research using genomic and transcriptomic approaches to improve CKD patient outcomes.",

Iron deficiency, which can lead to\nanemia, represents a major component of the global disease burden worldwide, especially in women. Iron\ndeficiency-related anemia affects >1.2 billion individuals worldwide, and iron deficiency without anemia is even\nmore frequent. Understanding the basic molecular mechanisms underlying specific iron disorders is critical to\ndesigning future therapeutic strategies. Approaches using iron supplementation or iron chelators are employed\nglobally to improve iron metabolism. However, their effectiveness can vary among patients due to the diverse\nmechanisms underlying iron disorders. Some etiologies are linked to impaired iron absorption in the intestine,\nwhile others involve issues with iron delivery to the bone marrow, which is crucial for sustaining erythropoiesis.\nThe goal of my program at The Jackson Laboratory is to identify the root causes of iron disorders, including iron\ndeficiency, iron deficiency anemia, anemia, and/or iron overload, by holistically investigating the fundamental\nbiological mechanisms of iron metabolism. By focusing on the etiology of these disorders rather than merely\naddressing the symptoms, we aim to facilitate personalized medicine tailored to each patient\u2019s specific needs.\nDuring the next five years, the AgoroLab will develop a novel computational framework, the Multi-Omics-Multi-\nOrgan sequencing (MOMO-seq), for studying mammalian iron systems biology in different tissues associated\nwith iron metabolism phenotypes and identify key organs, cells, and molecular features that drive iron disorders.\nMOMO-seq couples the power of single-cell multi-omics technology to profile DNA accessibility with\ntranscriptomics/histopathology approaches to study iron biology across multiorgan systems, enabling the\nidentification of cell-specific mechanisms and inter-organ communication circuits associated with iron\nmetabolism. Within our framework, we will be able to shed light on some of the key yet unanswered questions\nin iron biology. This includes deconvoluting the complex multiorgan signaling network that maintains iron\nhomeostasis. For instance, how does the bone marrow communicate with the spleen to meet the high iron\ndemand of erythropoiesis? How do kidneys regulate iron reabsorption? Developing MOMO-seq will be pivotal in\nestablishing and strengthening my independent research program, as well as laying the groundwork for an\ninnovative, comprehensive approach to studying iron metabolism and its implications in health and disease.",

Beyond\nincreased scientific challenges (such as data integration and harmonization), so too do the challenges to\ncoordinate, communicate, and collaborate effectively within the Program increase. The proposed project includes\nfour major research projects, supported by three resource cores, executed by a diverse multi-disciplinary team\ndistributed across five research institutions. The goal of this Administrative (Admin) Core is to facilitate their\ncoordination, communication, and collaboration. Our leadership team has extensive experience coordinating and\nmanaging large, multi-investigator programs; most notably as a small animal testing center in Somatic Cell\nGenome Editing (SCGE) Phase I funding, and as a precision genetics center (JAX Center for Precision Genetics,\nJCPG) improving animal models of human disease and move them towards translation to the clinic. In each of\nthese programs, we have established frameworks for organizing our teams, sharing information across projects\nand institutions, tracking progress and milestones, and communicating progress to key stakeholders as well as\nthe NIH program officers. Our previous experience leading Administration/Coordination Cores for multi-\ninstitutional, NIH-funded Programs makes us uniquely qualified to develop and execute on the administrative\ngoals of this U19. The Admin Core will provide managerial and administrative structure for this U19 Program\nthrough the following Aims. In Aim 1 we establish an effective administrative governance structure to assure\nsuccess of this U19 Program. We use prior experience and Program-specific characteristics to build a clear\nhierarchy of governance and include guidance from clinical experts in neurodegenerative diseases to hasten\nIND application. In Aim 2 we develop a formal meeting schedule to foster the communication needed to execute\non the goals of this proposal. The Admin Core will be responsible for managing this schedule, recording, and\nreporting out on the progress and action items identified in these meetings. The Admin Core will use these\nreports to monitor progress toward milestones of the Program and each Project for Aim 3, assisting NIH Program\nofficials in their alignment of our Program with SCGE Phase II. Finally, the Admin Core will communicate the\nfindings from this U19 Program with the Translational Coordination and Dissemination Center for external\ndistribution and assist in the creation of a shared learning and training education hub.",

The purpose of the Coordination Core is to ensure productive interactions\namong all participants and to oversee and facilitate all administrative and scientific functions of the JCPG,\nincluding the review of new external disease nominations. Under the direction of the JCPG PD/PIs and the\nProgram Manager, and with support from dedicated staff, the Coordination Core executes its duties with the\nguidance of a Steering Committee (SC) and an External Advisory Board (EAB). Specific responsibilities include:\n1) scientific oversight and leadership of the JCPG; 2) execution of the outreach plan to recruit nominations for\nmodel generation from the medical/scientific community; 3) fiscal and research resource management and\nallocation; 4) promotion of free and dynamic scientific exchange by facilitating interactions among JCPG\npersonnel, the EAB, external stakeholders and collaborators; and 5) the evaluation of projects, cores and the\nJCPG in line with the mission and milestones of our proposed Center and NIH goals. The Coordination Core\nwas the critical organizing force for the JCPG during the current funding phase, as demonstrated through key\nactivities including assembling SC and EAB members; establishing, tracking and evaluating key program metrics\nof success; ensuring timely and effective communications across JCPG stakeholders; coordinating collaborative\nmeetings with diverse teams of researchers, clinicians, and foundations; refining processes to maximize access\nto JAX\u2019s wealth of services and expertise; overseeing the intake and review of new nominations; and broadening\ncommunity awareness of and engagement with the Center. The Core will continue to perform these and related\nactivities to ensure the Center\u2019s continued impact and success in the next funding period. The Coordination Core\nwill achieve its goals through three Specific Aims: 1) Strengthen integration and function of JCPG activities\nthrough strong administrative and technical oversight; 2) Promote center productivity and scientific synergy\nthrough effective communication and outreach; and 3) Refine and prioritize variant nominations for the center.",

The majority of mutations\nare dominant missense mutations that cluster in the conserved motor domain of the protein and lead to a\nspectrum of neurological phenotypes beginning in childhood, including muscle weakness, microcephaly,\nperipheral neuropathy, intellectual disability, autism, optic nerve and cerebellar atrophy. Without treatment,\nchildren and adults affected by KAND suffer from the progressive loss of their mobility, vision and even early\ndeath due to intractable epilepsy and complications of respiratory illness. Mouse models are a critical component\nto both understanding disease mechanisms and to serve as a key platform for preclinical testing of novel\ntherapeutics. Unfortunately, mouse models to advance our understanding of KAND biology and therapeutics are\nseverely lacking, although very much in reach.\nThis proposal aims to build on our current knowledge of KAND to design mouse models that will not only provide\npatient avatars for KAND disease pathophysiology but will also serve to address important questions around the\ntiming of therapeutic rescue, effects of overexpression, what cell types are required for effective treatment and\nhow much genetic correction is required for disease modulation. Importantly, the models will be valuable for pre-\nclinical testing of therapeutics. The work described in this proposal leverages recently published Natural History\nStudies by our clinical collaborator, Dr. Wendy Chung, which provides ongoing insight into the clinical features,\nprevalence and biomarkers associated with this patient community. Our overall goals are to provide the scientific\ncommunity with well designed, rigorously tested mouse models that recapitulate key aspects of KAND disease\nmanifestations to be used, without restriction, throughout academia and industry for research and therapeutic\ndiscovery.",

Highly sophisticated genome engineering technologies, a well-characterized genome,\nmammalian physiology and economical husbandry requirements make laboratory mice the mainstay of\nbiomedical research on disease mechanism and for disease modeling. The NIH has recognized that the\npotential impact of genetically engineered mice for biomedical research cannot be fully realized without a\ncentralized effort to identify, archive, evaluate, characterize, and distribute valuable strains of mice to qualified\nbiomedical researchers. The MMRRC provides this centralized repository function. With over 80 years of\nmouse genetics and mouse resource experience, The Jackson Laboratory joined the MMRRC in 2009 and\nsince has been a key member of the consortium. This proposal requests on-going support for The Jackson\nLaboratory as one of the four MMRRC core repositories.

Interventions are tested in parallel at three\nsites (The Jackson Laboratory, University of Michigan, and University of Texas) using identical standardized\nprotocols. Such treatments include pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, foods, dietary supplements, plant extracts,\nhormones, peptides, amino acids, chelators, redox agents, and other compounds or mixtures of compounds. We\npropose to advance the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD) in response to emerging needs of the aging research\ncommunity, specifically the ITP, to continue being a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) that curates ITP data,\nmakes it available through a public database, and provides tools that enable users to visualize, analyze, and\ndownload the primary and summary data from these studies. Our objectives are to provide a central repository\nfor data, documentation, and protocols, offering a unique and important venue for ITP investigators needing to\nmake their data public; to continually refine and develop tools and features to best locate, present, and analyze\nthose datasets; and to maintain, enhance, and promote this resource to further enable quantitative, standardized\nand predictive phenotype studies and, in turn facilitate new scientific advances in the field of aging. We have\ndesigned a publicly accessible website and data repository for the ITP. We have also curated and posted data\nfrom numerous ITP studies. ITP plans for the next five years include additional lifespan trials, detailed analyses\nof agents found to increase lifespan, and continued growth in data on health outcomes. To help support these\ngoals, our specific aims are to: 1) maintain information on experimental designs, protocols, and SOPs, 2) create,\nmaintain, and update a publicly accessible electronic inventory of samples in the Interventions Biospecimens\nRepository (IBR), 3) coordinate data collection among the three ITP Centers and members of the research\ncommunity conducting focused, ancillary studies on specific interventions, 4) provide a statistical core for\nindependent analysis of data collected by ITP, 5) implement interactive and dynamic visualization tools for\nstatistical analyses and data reuse, and 6) maintain a public-access interactive website and machine accessible\ndata repository for ITP. Successful completion of our Aims will yield a widely useful and sustainable system for\npublic access to experimental details and analysis of ITP data. The resource will have a modern interactive\nenvironment and expose the data for many applications that support replication, extension, and interpretation of\nITP studies in the context of lifespan, health span, and disease biology research. This will help maximize the\nvalue of these data and provide the traceability and reproducibility required for extension and translation of the\noutcomes of ITP testing.",

Studying model organisms can provide insight, aid in prioritization, and\nfacilitate translation of research findings into practice by improving the interpretation of modeling and\nunderstanding human disease with insights gained from mouse phenotypic analysis across diverse\npopulations. Broader global data integration is needed such that data can come from across populations with\nnew representations, visualizations, and imputations. Better interoperation is needed to bring the data closer to\nhuman genetics with improved user interfaces for more efficient data selection such that less \u201cmouse insider\u201d\ninsight is required. Our objectives are to provide a central repository for more breadth and unification of human\ndisease-relevant data and better representation of measurement relevance to disease states, offering a unique\nand important venue for investigators needing to make their data public through NIH Data Management and\nSharing Plans; to continually refine and develop tools and features to best locate, present, and analyze those\ndatasets; and to maintain, enhance, and promote this resource to further enable quantitative, standardized and\npredictive phenotype studies and, in turn, facilitate new scientific advances. We will achieve these objectives in\nthree Specific Aims. Aim 1: We will expand the Mouse Phenome Database to include more extensive\nphenotype data by curating, annotating, organizing, and archiving those data to enhance interpretative use of\nMPD and improve the representation of measurement-to-trait annotations. Aim 2: We will enhance the MPD\ntool set to enable multivariate biostatistical and statistical genetics analysis to support use of phenotypic data\nto interpret and model genetic variation in human disease. Aim 3: We will enhance the implementation of MPD\nas a set of modern APIs to enable more versatile machine access and to expose mouse data to quantitative\nanalysis in light of human disease and other model organism empirical studies. Impact: The proposed efforts\nwill help maximize the value of these data and provide the traceability and scientific rigor required for extension\nand translation. Completion of the proposed work will result in a powerful, interoperable system for public\naccess to and analysis of mouse phenotype data and will ultimately provide researchers a seamless\nexperience for the extrapolation of model organism genetics data to human genetic variation.",

We\nhave incorporated known senescence inducers (e.g. Doxorubicin, Palbociclib, high fat diet) in the mouse model\nand shared relevant tissues (lung, muscle, ovary) with other SenNet TMCs for analysis. In the parent grant to\nthis supplement, we have established The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Cellular Senescence Network Tissue\nMapping Center (JAX-Sen TMC) focused on the analysis of mouse tissue to address a significant research and\nclinical need for improved biomarkers and cellular maps of senescence. Advances in our understanding of\nbiological aging and the recognition of aging as a modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases and geriatric\nsyndromes are fueling a growing interest in the cellular underpinnings of the aging process. Despite recent\nprogress in cellular senescence research and the discovery of new senolytics and senomorphics, we lack clear\ninformation regarding the role of cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease, and the effect of genetic\nvariation on these phenomena. In the JAX-Sen TMC we are mapping senescent cells in the context of multiple\nage-matched tissues of genetically defined mouse cohorts, raised in standardized environments throughout their\nlifespan and defining senescent cell phenotypes associated to features of genetics, age and senolytic\ninterventions. The tissues of specific focus within the JAX-Sen TMC are kidney, pancreas, heart, and placenta.\nThis supplement aims to generate detailed tissue mapping data on the mouse pancreas and kidney derived from\nour senescence inducers study and perform the analysis of this data using our existing framework. Specifically,\nwe will employ bulk RNA-seq, H&E, CODEX multiplexed antibody imaging, and Xenium in situ RNA spatial\nprofiling. Senescent cells identified from the senescent inducers experiment will be directly compared to those\nfrom natural aging, and provide the foundation for future senolytic/senomorphic functional studies.",

JAX-Sen is organized around three cores nested in the well-resourced\nenvironment for aging research and multi-omics profiling at JAX. JAX-Sen will profile senescent cells in kidney,\nadipose tissue, placenta, pancreas, heart, and hypothalamus, selected for their clinical relevance to chronic\ndiseases of aging, the domain expertise of the JAX-Sen leadership team in the biology of these tissues, and the\noverlap of four of the tissues with KAPP-Sen. We will leverage cutting-edge mouse resources including the\nDiversity Outbred, which offers unparalleled genetic diversity for modelling a range of molecular senescence\nphenotypes, and new inbred (C57BL/6J) transgenic mice that express p16 and p21 driven fluorescent tags to\nallow visualization enrichment for specific senescent cell subsets. The Biological Analysis Core will apply a\nmultitude of analytical modalities to selected tissues (bulk and single cell and single nucleus RNAseq, Visium\nspatial transcriptomics, multiplexed antibody-based imaging, multiplexFISH, imaging mass spectrometry\nincluding lipidomics, metabolomics, proteomics, 3D tissue reconstruction from serial sections), and will re-\nevaluate these technologies throughout the project period to ensure our approaches align with those of other\ncenters and that we maximally benefit from the technology development efforts in SenNet. These profiling\nactivities will yield subcellular resolution of biomolecular content in senescent cells not possible with human\nsamples, along with an expanded set of senescent cell biomarkers. The Data Analysis Core will combine robust\ncomputational capability with scalable and reproducible scientific workflows to develop and implement Network-\nwide open data and metadata standards. The Data Analysis Core will benefit from JAX\u2019s unique mouse research\nresources to establish the diversity of senescence by integrating with expression quantitative trait locus and\nprotein quantitative trait locus data in DO mice and JAX bioinformatics resources, e.g., Mouse Genome\nInformatics, Mouse Phenome Database, Monarch Initiative. The integrative mining of JAX-Sen data will lead to\nnovel methods for multi-modal 3D map reconstruction from imaging data and will yield an important resource for\nSenNet interpretation and enrichment of human senescent cell data. Finally, the Administrative Core will provide\nstrong oversight of project progress and nurture a culture of collaborative, dynamic scientific exchange within\nJAX-Sen. It will also maximize JAX-Sen\u2019s engagement in the consortium through collaborative activities that will\nhelp optimize data generation activities and create new research synergies. In so doing, JAX-Sen will help\nachieve the goal of SenNet to generate a unprecedented atlas of mouse senescent cells and new biomarkers of\nsenescence for human analysis and therapeutic application.",

Individuals with CH have increased risk of developing blood\ncancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Thus, CH is a healthspan-limiting\ncondition. Understanding how and why CH occurs with aging, and defining effective interventions to extend\nhealthspan, have strong potential to reduce the frequency or severity of CH-associated diseases in aged\nindividuals. Our laboratory has recently made formative discoveries that the aging bone marrow\nmicroenvironment and impaired HSC mitochondrial function cooperate to cause HSC aging. These\ndiscoveries have inspired us to define the components of aging that contribute to positive selection of CH-\nmutant HSCs. The major goal of this proposal is to determine processes by which hematopoietic-intrinsic and\n-extrinsic factors cause age-associated CH. Using a mouse model of a common CH mutation in DNMT3A, our\npreliminary data demonstrate that both hematopoietic-intrinsic and -extrinsic adaptive mechanisms facilitate\nselective advantage of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs in the context of aging. We hypothesize that Dnmt3a-mutant\nHSCs are adapted to survive and self-renew in an aging microenvironment through enhanced mitochondrial\nmetabolism, and that they promote premature senescence of the microenvironment to further their selective\nadvantage. In Aim 1, we will identify the specific mitochondrial alterations in Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs that\nfunctionally increase their competitive advantage in an aging microenvironment. In Aim 2, we will determine\nthe mechanisms by which Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs induce senescence of mesenchymal stromal cells in the BM\nmicroenvironment. In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which targeting mesenchymal stromal cell\nsenescence will reduce the functional competitive advantage of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs and progression to\nhematologic pathology. Successful completion of this project will determine the mechanisms by which\nhematopoietic-intrinsic and -extrinsic processes confer a competitive advantage to Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs\nduring aging. We expect that understanding these mechanisms will allow prioritization of targets for\ntherapeutic intervention to limit CH-associated pathologies including myeloid malignancies, cardiovascular\ndisease, and type 2 diabetes.",

Since most disease-associated variants\noccur in regulatory elements rather than coding genes, delineating the role of regulatory variation in normal health\nand disease is a critical pursuit of modern genomics. Further, when variants disrupt gene regulation early in\ndevelopment, it can lead to lasting defects in the structure and function of adult tissues. Regulatory element\nfunction is determined by, and can be identified through, combinatorial sets of post-translational modifications\non chromatin. To understand how genetic variation impacts chromatin modification and function and results in\nchanges in development, we exploit the rich resources in mammalian diversity by deploying a novel cellular\nsystems genetics approach using stem cells to model cell fate and differentiation. In the past 5 years, we\nestablished this innovative platform and developed a productive program to study how genetic variability in the\nepigenome shapes chromatin organization, subsequent gene expression, and cell identity. Specifically, we\ndefined extensive trans-regulation of the pluripotent genome and identified genetically determined differentiation\npropensity. The Baker lab is continuing to harness these collective strategies and build on these findings to\naddress the following gaps in our knowledge: What are the molecules and mechanisms underlying regulation of\nthe chromatin landscape? How does genetic variation influence chromatin structure and function? How does\nvariation in the establishment of the chromatin landscape impact differentiation and development? In the current\nproposal, we will determine how the trans-regulation of chromatin impacts developmental disorders and answer\noutstanding questions in the exaptation of transposable elements. We will develop tools to screen chromatin\nregulators for their modification of developmental disorders and transposable element regulation. We will also\ndetermine how genetic variation impacts expanded stem cell populations that contribute to extra-embryonic\ntissue, improving the fidelity and reproducibility of ex vivo models of development. Together, this research\nprogram will continue to shed light on the fundamental regulatory processes that shape genome function by\ncombining discovery-based approaches through cellular systems genetics and hypothesis-driven mechanistic\nstudies, which will be critical to fully realize the potential of regenerative medicine.",

However, the majority of\nresearch to date that has utilized stem cells has employed genetically-limited murine cells or clonal human cell\nlines with little attention paid to the impact of cellular genetic diversity on the phenotypic and functional outcomes\nand its relevance to human diversity. Importantly, recent data from murine and human studies of pluripotent stem\ncells indicate that genetic variability is the most significant driver of molecular and cellular differences in\nphenotype, including the ease of establishment of pluripotent cell lines, the rate of spontaneous differentiation,\nreprogramming differentiated cells to a pluripotent state, and the future use of stem cells as personalized\ntherapeutics. Thus, there is now an unmet need, not rigorously addressed at current conferences, to understand\nthe consequences of genetic variation on stem cell biology and their impact on development. To fill this gap, we\npropose the unique and timely conference \u201cDiversity in a Dish: Pluripotent Stem Cells in Genetic Analysis and\nDisease Modeling\u201d to facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and collaborations between experts in mouse and\nhuman genetics, cell biology, and pluripotency, and to engage diverse learners who are the next generation of\nstem cell researchers. We propose an annual, intensive 3-day conference beginning in 2023 at The Jackson\nLaboratory in Bar Harbor, ME. We will bring together 50 scientists, spanning career stages, from the fields of\ngenetics, cell biology, and pluripotency, as well as provide a virtual attendance option for those that cannot or\nchoose not to attend in person. For Aim 1, we will convene an interdisciplinary symposium organized around\ncutting-edge research seminars, workshops that focus on technical skill acquisition, and rigor and reproducibility\nas applied to stem cell research and genomic analyses. In Aim 2, we will promote interactive and inclusive\nactivities, to promote networking, mentorship, learner involvement, collaborative research, and career\ndevelopment. These activities include trainee presentations and short talks, and evening discussions focused\non research projects, rigor and ethics, and grantsmanship. These objectives are facilitated by the residential\nnature of the JAX Highseas Conference Center. In Aim 3, we will promote diversity in both the recruitment of\nparticipants and in the tools being generated to study models of human disease. Diverse attendees will be\nactively recruited, scholarships will be provided to enable in-person attendance, and an inclusive virtual option\nwill enable participation by those that are unable to travel. Diversity will also be emphasized in the context of\nbest practices for research, including the need for studies of genetically diverse panels of stem cells, and fair\nacquisition, representation, and distribution of cell lines from wider representation of backgrounds to ensure the\nbenefits discovered from these biomedical resources are shared equitably.",

Current knowledge about treatment failure is mostly derived from\nresearch on intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance in epithelial tumor cells. However, recent studies have\nimplicated a critical role for host cells (i.e., the tissue microenvironment) in building a protective \u201cniche\u201d for\ntumor cells enabling their escape from chemotherapeutic treatments. Notably, the host regenerative response\nupon chemotherapy \u201cinjury\u201d, which is regarded as a host intrinsic mechanism to repair damaged tissues, may\nbe exploited by tumor cells for their local recurrence or distant metastases. The proposed study will build on\nour extensive experience in the study of tumor-stroma interactions in breast cancer metastasis, and will\ninvestigate the poorly explored question of how chemotherapy-induced changes in the lung stroma foster the\nearly relapse of tumor cells in the lung. Based on our previous findings that tissue resident mesenchymal stem\ncells (MSCs) acquire a significantly higher potential to promote local tumor growth upon cancer therapies, we\nhypothesize that systemic chemotherapy treatment stimulates regenerative responses in lung resident MSCs,\nwhich are, in turn, utilized by drug-resistant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) for their metastatic relapse in the\nlung. By designing different chemotherapy treatment scenarios in animal models mimicking clinical situations\nin human breast cancer patients, we will in Aim 1 determine how chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and\ndoxorubicin modulate the lung resident MSCs using our newly established endogenous MSC modeling\nplatform in mice. Subsequently, we will in Aim 2 delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-activated\nlung resident MSCs to support metastatic tumor growth in the lung, with a focus on the TLR4 signaling\npathway and the key wound healing cytokine osteopontin (OPN). Finally, we will in Aim 3 define the\ntranslational potential of stroma targeting approaches using both patient-derived xenograft models and breast\ncancer patient specimen analyses. We will specifically focus on the therapeutic efficacy of combining\nchemotherapy with TLR4 or OPN blockage in treatment of patient-derived human basal-like xenograft breast\ntumors. Further, by analyzing clinical plasma samples from human breast cancer patients, we expect to\ndevelop plasma OPN as a biomarker to predict early metastatic relapse of breast cancer patients after\nchemotherapy. Overall, our proposed study will energize an underdeveloped field of research that investigates\nthe impact of cancer therapeutics on the pre-metastatic microenvironment. Findings from the proposed study\nwill facilitate the development of clinically applicable strategies to improve treatment efficacy and prevent\nmetastatic relapse of breast cancer by interfering with the tissue metastatic microenvironment.",

Among the vital organs to which solid\ntumors metastasize, the lung is one of the most common. Lung metastases frequently occur in various late\nstage solid cancers including breast cancer. In the past 20 years, significant advances in lung metastasis\nresearch have revealed intricate interactions between the disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and the lung\nmicroenvironment that are essential for the development of metastatic lung lesions. In particular, formation of\nthe immunosuppressive lung pre-metastatic microenvironment (niche), which is driven by factors secreted by\nprimary tumors, is regarded as a key preparation stage prior to the arrival of DTCs. The focus of this proposal\nwill be on the lung resident mesenchymal cells (MCs), an under-characterized stromal cell population within\nthe lung pre-metastatic niche. Preliminary studies in mouse models of breast cancer suggest that lung resident\nMCs serve as a driver of immunosuppressive pre-metastatic niche formation by reprogramming diverse types\nof myeloid cells to become highly immunosuppressive or tolerogenic. The central hypothesis of this proposal is\nthat lung resident MCs drive formation of the lung pre-metastatic niche by endowing diverse infiltrating\nmyeloid cells with an immunosuppressive capacity. To test this hypothesis and uncover mechanisms by\nwhich MCs modulate myeloid cells, we propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Determine the lung resident MC\nchanges in the pre-metastatic niche using genetic manipulation of endogenous MCs in mice. We will\nuse orthotopic breast tumor cell implantation and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) tumor models to\nmeasure the endogenous MC changes at the pre-metastatic stage. MCs will also be ablated in vivo to\ndetermine their necessity for pre-metastatic niche formation. Aim 2: Characterize the key lung\nmesenchymal factors that recruit and modulate myeloid cells. We will use RNA sequencing to profile\ntranscriptome changes between endogenous MCs residing in pre-metastatic vs. normal lungs to identify\nupregulated genes that might play a role in modulating myeloid cells. The contribution of candidate MC genes\nto pre-metastatic niche formation will be evaluated through MC-specific gene knockout. Aim 3: Target lung\nMCs as a strategy for abolishing the immunosuppressive lung pre-metastatic niche in preclinical\nmodels. Using orthotopic tumor implantation models, we will test the ability of lung MC blockade agents to\nboost lung anti-tumor immunity and prevent lung metastasis. These studies will be a significant step toward our\nlong-term goal to fully dissect the roles of organ-specific stromal cells in organ-tropic metastases of breast\ncancer. We anticipate that our findings will establish a strong foundation for the development of novel\ntherapeutic strategies that target stromal factors for the prevention and treatment of lung metastases of breast\ncancer and other solid tumors.",

Collectively these support\nmetabolic homeostasis and barrier function of the retina.\nMany RPE disease phenotypes are shared between humans and mouse models carrying mutations in cell-\nadhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Defining causative pathways and networks that are induced\nby mutations or pathogenic variants may provide therapeutic targets. Identifying druggable targets that act during\nthe pre-symptomatic stage of the disease is particularly important to enable development of therapies that can\nprevent, delay onset, or decrease the severity of RPE-associated diseases, irrespective of the initial cause of\nthe disease, before the pathologic changes become irreversible.\n The goal of this application is to identify shared pre-clinical and end-stage phenotypic and cellular effects of\nmutations in two genes, Ctnna1 and Lratd2, which are highly expressed in the RPE and lead to similar retinal\ndefects. Mutations in CTNNA1 have been reported in patients with Pattern Dystrophy and Lebers Congenital\nAmaurosis (LCA), and LRATD2 has been associated with early AMD in a genome wide association study. Our\napproach is to use clinical, functional and biochemical tests to provide a deep characterization of the models and\nto analyze associated cellular changes using single-nuclear transcriptomics as well as spatial\nmetabolomic/proteomic measurements. These phenotypic and genomics data will be jointly analyzed using\ncomputational methods to identify the shared pathways perturbed in these models. Our use of two models with\nshared pathologies will let us filter out mutation specific alterations and focus on the shared disease-causing\npathways. Using our mouse resources, we also plan to enhance current models.\n Successful completion of our studies will identify novel pathogenic pathways underlying RPE-related\ndisorders, revealing potential therapeutic targets that could be effective in a broad range of these diseases,\nregardless of the cause of the disease. These well-characterized models will be made available to the research\ncommunity for further mechanistic inquiries as well as for testing therapeutic strategies.",

Communication at apical junctions between hair cells and their glial neighbors,\nthe supporting cells, is particularly important for proper hair cell orientation. While supporting cells are known to\nrelay polarity signals between hair cells, the possible influence of polarity mechanisms on their own differentiation\nis not well-studied. Pillar and Deiter's cells, specific types of supporting cells, have a complex and asymmetrical\nmorphology beneath the epithelial surface. These cells develop apical extensions called phalangeal processes,\nwhich interdigitate between hair cells and play a critical scaffolding role in cochlear amplification and thus auditory\nfunction. The proposed research hypothesizes that mouse Pillar and Deiter's cells acquire their phalangeal\nprocesses through a postnatal polarization program similar to the polarization of hair bundles in hair cells.\nPreliminary results suggest that the basal body of supporting cells is planar-polarized and can exhibit a highly\ndynamic behavior during development. We aim to track the position of the basal body in supporting cells from\nembryogenesis to adulthood, correlate its position with the emergence of dense microtubule arrays in the\nunderlying phalangeal process, and investigate defects in one relevant cell polarity mutant context. Additionally,\nwe aim to develop methods for sparse labeling of supporting cells to track their individual morphology and\nanalyze structural changes during phalangeal process development. Examining the polarization of supporting\ncells offers a novel perspective to address their complex remodeling, a neglected aspect of auditory science\nwhere new approaches and tools have potential for significant discoveries. Beyond providing a better\nfundamental understanding of supporting cell development, this groundwork will enable the analysis of\nmorphometric changes in mutants causing congenital hearing loss. This work also has broader potential for\nstudying supporting cell integrity in various conditions including aging and trauma such as noise damage.",

                                    "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nDeafness at birth frequently originates from defects in the development of sensory cells in the inner ear. Likewise,\nhearing degradation during life frequently follows damage sustained by these cells after normal development. In\neach case, a particularly susceptible cellular compartment is the hair bundle, a specialized structure in each\nsensory cell that detects and relays sound-borne vibrations. The hair bundle is an array of actin-based membrane\nprotrusions, or stereocilia, precisely organized in rows of graded heights. Although the tiered architecture of the\nhair bundle is fundamental for sensory function, the molecular machinery required for its assembly during\ndevelopment and for the maintenance of its exact dimensions during life remains obscure. To address these\nopen questions, we propose to exploit knowledge gained from our ongoing investigations of the GPSM2-G\u03b1i\nprotein complex in mouse. Absence of the scaffold protein GPSM2 or inhibitory G proteins (G\u03b1i) result in\ndefective hair bundle assembly, a likely etiology for congenital hearing loss in Chudley-McCullough syndrome.\nThe GPSM2-G\u03b1i protein complex is first enriched on one side of the nascent hair bundle only (the bare zone),\nand then enriched at the tip of stereocilia in the adjacent first row, a distribution required for proper stereocilia\nplacement and elongation, respectively. We showed that the Myosin-15A motor transports GPSM2-G\u03b1i to\nstereocilia tips, where in turn GPSM2-G\u03b1i increases Myosin-15A amounts compared to other rows to define the\ntallest identity of the first row. Based on detailed preliminary data, we hypothesize that, 1) As yet unstudied G\u03b1i\nregulators act as upstream cues to selectively enrich the GPSM2-G\u03b1i complex only in the bare zone region of\nthe apical membrane and only in a single row of stereocilia. 2) Prior GPSM2-G\u03b1i enrichment on one side of the\nnascent hair bundle is the mechanism by which GPSM2-G\u03b1i becomes restricted to abutting stereocilia in the\nfirst row, giving the hair bundle its tiered architecture. 3) Continued enrichment of GPSM2-G\u03b1i at stereocilia tips\nafter development has a role in maintenance of proper stereocilia height and girth in adult hair bundles. To test\nthese hypotheses, we will: 1) Characterize the role of a negative G\u03b1i protein regulator that we already established\nas a new deafness gene critical for GPSM2-G\u03b1i complex localization and hair bundle morphogenesis. 2) Use a\nnew chemical protein labeling technology and new reporter mouse models to track discrete pools of GPSM2-\nG\u03b1i and follow their dynamic trafficking to the bare zone and stereocilia tips in time. 3) Inactivate GPSM2-G\u03b1i\nfunction in structurally and functionally normal hair bundles in adults, and monitor stereocilia dimensions,\nstereocilia actin dynamics and mouse auditory function. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms that shape\nand preserve hair bundles will help interpret and design treatments for sensory cell dysfunction, the principal\ncause of hearing loss.",

                                    "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a collection of inherited peripheral neuropathies with a cumulative\nincidence of ~1:2500 people. There is no approved treatment for any of the 100 genetic subtypes of CMT,\npresenting a large unmet clinical need. Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2D is caused by dominant mutations in glycyl\ntRNA synthetase (GARS), encoding the enzyme that charges glycine onto its cognate tRNAs during translation.\nOur working model for the disease mechanism is that the mutant enzyme binds its tRNA substrate, but does not\nrelease it to the ribosome, effectively sequestering the substrate. This results in ribosome stalling at glycine\ncodons and activation of the integrated stress response. Support for this mechanism comes from genetic studies\nin Drosophila and mouse models of CMT2D, in which transgenic overexpression of tRNAGlyGCC was able to\neffectively suppress the neuropathy phenotype. In preliminary studies, we have reproduced this result using\nAAV9 to deliver tRNAGly genes to three different CMT2D mouse models. Glycine has four codons (GGC, GGG,\nGGA, and GGU), and therefore four potential anticodons (GCC, CCC, UCC, and ACC respectively, though ACC\nis likely a nonfunctional tRNA). We made four AAV9 vectors expressing each tRNAGly anticodon driven by a\nPolIII U6 promoter. We found that GCC was highly effective, almost completely suppressing the neuropathy\nphenotype even in mice with a severe allele of Gars. Vectors expressing CCC and UCC were intermediate in\nefficacy, and ACC was ineffective (as anticipated). This profile of efficacy correlates with tRNA abundance and\ncodon usage, and suggests we are replacing the sequestered substrates of GARS with the AAVs. In the R61\nphase of this proposal we will optimize the vector payload (Aim 1) and capsid (Aim 2), and in the R33 phase\n(Aim 3), we will use this optimized vector in rigorous preclinical studies in mouse models of CMT2D. In Aim 1\n(R61), we will construct an AAV9 vector that carries all three effective tRNAGly genes (GCC, CCC, UCC) in a\nsingle vector. We will compare this against GCC alone, which was very effective. In Aim 2 (R61), we will\nrecreate the U6-GCC vector in a MACPNS capsid in an attempt to create a vector that is effective with systemic\ndelivery, rather than dosing directly into the nervous system. We will compare the MACPNS-GCC vector to\nAAV9-GCC. In Aim 3 (R33), we will test the optimized vector (GCC or combined tRNAGlys, AAV9 or MACPNS)\nin two mouse models of CMT2D. We will also allow treated mice to age to show the perdurance of the effect,\nand we will examine the effects of treating after the onset of neuropathy. The successful completion of these\naims will show the in vivo efficacy of an optimized gene therapy treatment for CMT2D in preclinical studies in\nmouse models. This will position us for further translational research and IND-enabling studies through\nmechanisms such as the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network for Biologicals.",

While immune dysfunction is a hallmark\nof AD pathogenesis, peripheral-central nervous system crosstalk is not completely understood, creating a barrier\nto the development of new therapeutics for prevention or cure. The foundation of proper immune responses is\nthe hematopoietic system's ability to produce well-functioning cells in correct proportions. Hematopoietic stem\ncells (HSCs), which produce all blood cells (including monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, and B cells), accumulate\nsomatic mutations over their long lifetimes. Certain mutations provide a selective advantage that results in an\nincreased expansion of those HSC \u201cclones\u201d and can lead to skewed proportions of and phenotypic changes in\nproduced cell types. The incidence of this phenomenon, termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH), increases with age\nand is associated with higher risk of multiple diseases. Surprisingly, CH has been recently reported to be\nassociated with decreased incidence of AD. To validate this association and propose an actionable mechanism\nfor clinical disease intervention, we need to understand how mutations in peripheral immune cells impact the\netiology and progression of AD. These studies necessitate mammalian models in which CH and AD\nproteinopathy are inducible in the same individual and blood and brain are available for examination prior to\ndisease onset and throughout disease progression. Our research objective is to investigate the impact of Tet2\nCH mutation on the ability of peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the brain and modulate AD pathology. To\nachieve our aims, we will introduce mutated cells into the circulation of well-defined AD mouse models. We will\nassess the effect of aging and proteinopathy development on the extent CH peripheral cell infiltration, identify\nand quantify infiltrating immune cells and their locations within the brain, determine whether circulating CH cells\nare increasingly primed for mobilization, and assess the effect of CH on AD pathology development. Determining\nthat a CH mutation a) increases the immune cell infiltration into the brain, and b) leads to deceased pathology\nwould provide a direct link between CH and AD and may nominate new candidates for therapeutic intervention\nfor AD.",

Mapping the risk genes for poor health\noutcomes is a major focus of biomedical research, and new approaches to improve genetic mapping power can\nhave a transformative impact on public health. Genetic disease risk manifests through complex interactions\nbetween gene regulation and tissue structure, ultimately influencing organ function. However, quantifying tissue\nstructure for quantitative genetic mapping has not been widely adopted. This is partly because histological\nscoring has traditionally been labor intensive and error prone, and limited to coarse measures (e.g., discrete\ncategories) that are suboptimal for association testing. In contrast, deep neural networks (DNNs) now routinely\nautomate laborious image quantification tasks for histopathology, making them an ideal platform for integrating\nhistology into genetic analysis. Furthermore, unlike human-defined histological scores, DNN readouts enable\nobjective histological trait discovery as a function of genetic, molecular, and physiological variation. In this\nproject, histological features will be rigorously and robustly quantified using DNNs and these data will be\nintegrated into novel multiscale statistical models that will connect genetic, molecular, and histological variation\nto physiological outcomes. In particular, novel methods will be developed to integrate histology into three major\nclasses of systems genetic analysis, i.e., heritable trait inference, causal mediation analysis, and molecular\nquantitative trait locus (mQTL) mapping. These methods will be developed and validated using a data set of\ngenetic, histological, transcriptomic, proteomic, and physiological data from a cohort of Diversity Outbred mice\nused for the study of age-related kidney disease. By using a model system, complex genetic effects and causal\nmediation hypotheses can be directly tested to validate and refine the analytical framework. The specific aims of\nthis proposal include: Aim 1: Identify maximally heritable histological traits through deep learning on paired\ngenotypes and histological images. Aim 2: Genetically map histological mediators of complex physiological traits\nusing deep learning on histological images. Aim 3: Identify causal paths connecting molecular QTLs (mQTLs) to\noutcomes through histological mediators. The outcome of this study will be a validated methodological framework\nfor histological systems genetics that is modular, enabling a wide range of users to incorporate appropriate\ncomputer vision tools into state-of-the-art systems genetics workflows for any complex disease.",

The auditory organ in the inner ear is\ncomposed of sensory hair cells that detect and transmit sound vibrations. Hair cells are innervated by bipolar\nspiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) that relay auditory signals from the hair cells to the brainstem. Damage causing\nSGN degeneration or affecting SGN projections or synapses with hair cells leads to hearing loss. Mitochondrial\ndysfunction is a common cause of pathologies targeting organs that require large amounts of energy to perform\noptimally, such as neurons. Nuclear DNA mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins can affect\nmitochondrial biogenesis or energy metabolism pathway, affecting auditory function in either case. A focus of this\nstudy, variants in the mitochondrial ACO2 protein have been associated with optic nerve atrophy, seizures, and\nhearing loss in young children. ACO2 is a nuclear gene that produces aconitase hydratase 2, an early enzyme\nin the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Unfortunately, cellular or mechanistic insight into ACO2-related conditions is\nlacking in part due to the absence of adequate animal models. We identified a spontaneous recessive R56L\namino acid substitution in the mouse Aco2 gene based on circling behavior. Homozygotes are viable but show\nearly-onset progressive hearing loss at 1 month of age followed by severe SGN loss at 2 months. I propose that\nthe ACO2 R56L protein variant results in SGN apoptosis due to mitochondrial dysfunction, explaining early-onset\nhearing loss. Aim 1 of this proposal will track SGN defects in the Aco2 R56L mutants from developmental stages\nto young adults. Aim 2 will investigate how the R56L mutation affects the dose and localization of the ACO2\nprotein, and establish how SGN mitochondria number and distribution is altered in time in mutants. Aim 3 will\nattempt to rescue mitochondrial defects and loss of SGNs in mutants via metabolic supplementation. This will\nfirst be tested in organ culture prior to exploiting these results in live mice to improve auditory function. The\nproposed research has the potential to help develop realistic treatments to prevent or rescue hearing loss in\nACO2 patients. Moreover, the new Aco2 R56L mouse strain will be invaluable to model other neurological\ndisorders in ACO2 patients, including optic atrophy.",

However, quantitative behavior analysis has dramatically accelerated and improved with the implementation and application of new machine learning methods, including new deep learning-based methods to track animals at high temporal and spatial resolution. This technology has broad current and potential application that will impact a breadth of fields that have direct relevance and impact on studies of human health and disease, including the fields of neuroscience, behavior, genetics, psychiatry, and biomedicine. However, several roadblocks limit the widespread adoption of these tools and analyses. First, many tracking and behavior analysis packages require a high level of computational expertise and are thus limited in application to expert labs. Second, with high-resolution data streams, quantitating behavior requires new statistical tools and proper modeling of data. Since the application of machine learning to behavioral analyses is an emerging and key methodology, we recognize an unmet need for investigators in a variety of relevant fields to learn the fundamentals of its rigorous use. Thus, to train a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of neuroscience, machine learning, and behavior, we propose to establish an annual 4-day workshop that brings together experts in quantitative behavior, computer vision, and experimental design to provide a practical introduction to the field of quantitative neuroethology and behavior: we propose the unique and timely interdisciplinary course The Short Course on the Application of Machine Learning for Automated Quantification of Behavior at the Jackson Laboratory (JAX). This Short Course will provide attendees (in-person and virtually) with; information on the state-of-the-art of machine learning based behavior quantitation, the fundamentals of behavior quantitation, hands-on workshops and data analysis, a forum for student-teacher interaction for networking, and training at the leading edge of computational ethology. Students will emerge from the course with the ability to: 1) design a high quality, adequately powered behavior experiment; 2) select and install a suitable platform for high-resolution analysis of animal behavior; 3) deploy a behavior data analysis strategy, including collecting new training datasets, training analysis software, and validating performance on held-out data; and 4) run workflows/pipelines that are necessary to analyze their data following extraction. To achieve this, we propose: Aim 1. To develop and deliver a 4-day workshop to train scientists on application of machine learning to animal behavior quantitation. Aim 2. To create an environment that will expand the field of quantitative behavior analysis by fostering idea generation, discussion, and collaboration to yield new discoveries, broader applications, and advance technology development. Aim 3. Foster the recruitment and development of junior investigators in neuroscience, behavioral genetics, and quantitative analysis of animal behavior.",

In response to this ongoing need, The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), in\npartnership with Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU), proposes a curriculum development\ninitiative, Genomics in Action, for community college students that will impart content knowledge and skills in\ngenetics and genomics to better prepare them for a variety of careers, such as laboratory, medical and nursing\nassistants. Community college students within the CSCU system are a highly diverse group, with approximately\n50% of students receiving financial assistance and 50% of students from minoritized populations. To achieve\nour objective, we propose the following Aims: 1. Develop 15 virtual modules on key topics in human\ngenomics, tailored to community college student needs. These modules will address curricular gaps as\nidentified through needs analysis with our CSCU faculty. Our innovative approach will utilize short video content\nto introduce topics, demonstrate concepts, as well as provide context for each topic within a career or job in the\ngenomics workforce. Each module will feature a near-peer who is employed in a role for which community college\nstudents are training. The modules will thus be designed to connect the genomics content and skills directly to\napplication in the workplace. 2. Disseminate fully digital modules to the broader community. Our team will\ndesign modules that can be seamlessly integrated into our CSCU partner institutions learning management\nsystems, and professional development workshops will be provided to facilitate adoption the Genomics in Action\nmodules among the broader CSCU community. We will also expand dissemination through JAX\u2019s online and\ndigital education program that provides free access to our interactive multimedia educational content, making\nthe modules available for use globally. To evaluate the impact of the Genomics in Action modules, pilot adoption\nwill take place during year 1 of the project and surveys will be administered to assess the effectiveness of the\nmodule delivery and usability by both faculty and students. Modules will be adapted, refined, and subsequently\ndelivered in courses again in years 2 and 3. We will examine overall uptake and use of the modules by our\npartner institutions and will track broader dissemination within other programs and institutions within the CSCU.\nProgram impact will also be assessed by tracking learners\u2019 career progress and retention in biomedicine\nfollowing program participation. By training community college students seeking entry-level positions, Genomics\nin Action will execute on NIH\u2019s goal of strengthening the future STEM workforce through increasing genomic and\nhealth literacy.",

                                    "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAs much as 10% of the population suffers from a rare disease (RD); 80% of these diseases are caused by\ngene mutations and up to 75% are present at birth or begin in childhood. Diagnosis of genetic diseases is often\nproblematic: roughly 25% of RD patients must wait between 5 and 30 years for a diagnosis, and about half of\nthe initial diagnoses are wrong. For many affected children, definitive diagnosis comes only after a protracted\nand frustrating odyssey of visits to different specialists. Emerging genetic sequencing techniques offer the\npossibility of shortening this long and costly path to diagnosis. Methods for determining the changes in gene\nsequences across all genes (exome sequencing) or all genetic material (genome sequencing), collectively\nreferred to as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and which were first used to identify the genetic cause of a\ndisease in 2010, are now becoming routine in the clinic. The ability to make a diagnosis with NGS has more\nthan doubled since 2010 for children with suspected genetic diseases. The diagnostic analysis of NGS data\ninvolves the assessment of tens of thousands (exome) or even millions (genome) of changes in the DNA\n(variants), which requires sophisticated computer algorithms that can sift through these/this data to find the\ncause. Our group has developed the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), a resource widely used around the\nworld for the computational analysis of clinical data in human genetics and pediatrics, allowing algorithms to\nmatch the symptoms of a patient with database records of over 7,000 genetic diseases.\nOur Exomiser software compares the clinical phenotypes of patients with known human diseases and\ngenetically modified animal models, and couples this with an analysis of the disease-causing potential of DNA\nvariants, greatly reducing the search space to identify the causal variant. Exomiser efficiently processes both\nexome and genome data. In this proposal, we plan to extend Exomiser to utilize new genomic data types\nincluding long-read genome sequencing and NGS-based analysis of RNA data, which will improve\npathogenicity prediction for structural variants (SVs) and for variants affecting gene expression or splicing. We\nwill also predict novel disease genes through characterization of networks of clinical phenotypes and the\nmolecular functions (pathways) of affected genes. We plan to use these algorithms to assess collections\n(cohorts) of unsolved cases in projects such as the 100,000 Genomes Project. Our algorithmic approach will\nbe applied to intelligently reanalyze unsolved cases periodically as new information is added to the medical\nliterature. And finally, we will develop tools to integrate Exomiser into a large range of settings by adding\nsupport for standards generated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). The proposed\nadvances will make Exomiser more efficient, more accurate, and easier for non-specialist pediatricians to use,\nbringing genomic diagnostics to routine pediatric clinical care.",

Tools for human studies\nhave advanced greatly yet there remains a necessary reliance on mammalian models. To this end new strains\nof mice have been created that better emulate the extent of human genetic variation. These strains include\nCollaborative Cross (CC), Diversity Outbred (DO) and recombinant inbred mice (e.g. BXD). The CC/DO and\nBXD platforms harness the natural inbred strain variation needed for systems genetics studies. However, the\nuse of these strains typically requires additional genetic engineering of the mice to create \u201ctool strains\u201d to allow\nspecific types of genetic manipulations. Such strains already exist for standard inbred strains (e.g. C57BL/6J),\nbut \u201ctool strains\u201d, that carry commonly needed genetic manipulations, are not presently available for genetically\ndiverse inbred strains such as CC/DO, BXD, or all of the founder inbred strains used to create these RI panels.\n The use of the powerful CC/DO/BXD strains is growing rapidly and to facilitate efficient use of these mice we\npropose to create a series of tool strains and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). To do this, we will take\nadvantage of diverse inbred strains that harbor novel, high efficiency recombinase-based docking sites to\nfacilitate the use of CRISPR-cas9 editing for creation of the new strains. Validated new tool strains will be\nmade available through the Special Mouse Strain Resource (SMSR).\n To achieve this goal we will:\n Derive and validate germ line competent mESC lines from existing Bxb1 integrase strains. The goal\nhere is to create a panel of genetically diverse mESC lines harboring Bxb1 integrase sites, as well as LSL-\nCas9-FLAG. These mESCs will provide tools for engineering loci that are difficult to engineer in zygotes or for\nvalidation experiments that can be accomplished in vitro.\n Generate Rosa26-LSL-Cas9-FLAG tool strains for CAST/EiJ, PWK/EiJ, and DBA/2J inbred strains.\nThese strains will enable CRISPR/cas9 editing in the absence of exogenous Cas9. This facilitates engineering\nin zygotes and allows for easy, precise engineering of somatic cells/tissues. The goal is to create and validate\nthis important tool strain for the three high priority inbred strain backgrounds listed above.\n Generate germ line deletion tool strains for CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ inbred strain backgrounds.\nRemoval of specific DNA sequences or engineering stop codons is frequently accomplished using flanking\nloxP sites that serve as catalytic domains for cre recombinase. Implementation of this approach frequently\nuses \u201cgerm line cre\u201d strains, that are not currently available on genetically diverse strain backgrounds. Thus,\nthe goal here is to take advantage of our Bxb1 docking site strains to create Rosa26 Sox2-cre knock-in alleles\non CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ.",

To date, little data exists for more than a quarter of these\ngenes and nearly one third have no functional annotation. Because of the high degree of similarity between the\nmouse and human gene set, genetic data generated in mice can often be extrapolated to human gene function.\nMouse models of genes with common functionality between mice and humans can lead to new models of\ndisease, which are useful for drug screening, preclinical studies, and deeper understanding of biological and\ndisease mechanism. The goal of the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) is to generate lines of\nmice that carry knockouts (KOs) for a genome-wide collection of mouse genes and subject the mice to broad\nbased phenotyping.\nJAX KOMP2 phase 3 proposes to use cutting-edge and cost-effective Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (Cas9 RGN,\nalso called CRISPR/Cas9) technology to generate, breed, cryopreserve and phenotype 600 lines of mice during\nthe project period. Continued effort will be made to improve the Cas9 RGN technology so as to reduce costs,\nincrease targeting efficiency, and create more complex mutant alleles. Genes will be selected in coordination\nwith our KOMP2 and IMPC partners and will focus on those that; have human orthologs, have not been\npreviously knocked out, have no or poor annotation, have significant community demand and integrate with other\nNIH-support programs, or are predicted to function in select pathways. To guarantee ready access to the\ncommunity, we will ship mice to outside investigators while they are alive on the shelf and deposit the lines into\nthe Mouse Mutant Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) repositories for future use.\nBroad based phenotyping on young adult mice up to 17 weeks of age will be performed on all 600 lines of mice\nusing International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)-required and JAX-specific protocols. We will assess\nbody weight and composition, and behavior, cardiovascular, metabolic, ocular and physiological parameters.\nBased on data generated from the current phase of KOMP2, we expect about 30% of lines to be non-viable. We\nwill characterize the non-viable mutants using high-throughput imaging modalities at three embryonic time points.\nBased on previous data we also expect approximately 7% of the lines to be infertile. Direct fertility testing to\nassess the fertility of each sex will be performed on all lines that fail to generate offspring from homozygous by\nhomozygous matings. All data generated from embryonic and adult mice will be rapidly deposited into the Data\nCoordination Center (DCC) that supports KOMP2 and the IMPC.\nLastly, JAX will work collaboratively with the KOMP2 Regional Network and with member organizations of the\nIMPC to share protocols, innovation, and new technology and to broadly and openly disseminate our findings to\nthe international community through publication, presentations at meetings, web activities, and social media.",

Strategies include pooled and individual\ngene knockouts and knockdowns (KDs), generated using CRISPR technologies and auxin-inducible degrons.\nFollowing application of such assays, molecular phenotypes of the cells are profiled longitudinally and at\nindividual time points using bulk and single-cell (sc)RNA-seq. Perturbation strategies have intrinsic sources of\nvariability, e.g., KD penetrance, while the single-cell sequencing approaches contribute technical noise, e.g.,\n`drop out.' Quantifying and controlling this variability are crucial to ensure reliable phenotypic assessment and\nfulfill MorPhiC's goal to accurately catalog gene function. Given the critical role of transcription factors (TFs) in\nregulating cell state, all four MorPhiC Data Production Centers (DPCs) will perturb TFs and then profile cells\nusing bulk or sc-RNA-seq. A wide range of other `regulatory phenotyping' data, including (bulk or single-cell)\nATAC-seq, are being generated within MorPhiC and TF ChIP-seq, HiC, and massively parallel reporter assay\n(MPRA) data are available in the ENCODE and Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) consortia. To\nrobustly define the regulatory impact of TF perturbation, we propose a JAX MorPhiC Data Analysis and Validation\nCenter (DAV) to analyze these multi-modal data. Our team is uniquely positioned to establish this TF-focused\nDAV: we are co-located with the JAX MorPhiC DPC and have consortium-level collaborations with its PI, while\nour own work focuses on elucidating transcriptional regulation of genes and on developing robust computational\nmethods through community efforts. In Aim 1, we will quantify and control variability in perturbation-based\nregulatory phenotyping by using heterogeneous data generated within MorPhiC to isolate their technical noise\ncharacteristics and to derive a set of TF-gene target pairs (TF-GTs). We will then computationally simulate large-\nscale perturbation screens, through which we will perform power analysis to quantify data variability and make\nrecommendations that ameliorate it. In Aim 2, we will evaluate published gene regulatory network (GRN)\ninference methods. We will also conduct two \u201ccrowd-sourced\u201d DREAM Challenges, in which community\nparticipants will develop GRN inference methods that we will objectively evaluate with MorPhiC data. Using top-\nperforming methods, as well as a novel approach we are developing based on dynamical systems, we will\nperform in silico TF perturbation within the GRNs to prioritize TFs for experimental validation in MorPhiC. In Aim\n3, we will further improve robustness of inferred TF-GTs by integrating them with TF ChIP-seq, HiC, and MPRA\ndata, knockout mouse phenotyping data (KOMP2), and spatial transcriptomics data from JAX and MorPhiC. We\nwill validate published methods for defining tissue-specific GRNs by overlapping them with relevant MorPhiC\nmodel systems and will then use them to predict TF-GTs in systems yet to be profiled by MorPhiC. Our Aims will\nbolster the field's ability to decipher the regulatory function of the ~ 1600 TF genes within the human genome.",

However, there are few options available for their treatment, and\nwithout pathomechanisms being sufficiently elucidated, one's ability to generate a rationale for interventions is\ngreatly limited. Our studies are expected to address this barrier by establishing new etiological factors and\nmolecular mechanisms of mammalian neurodegeneration. One such mechanism is Ribosome-associated\nQuality Control (RQC), that mediates the degradation of incomplete polypeptides produced by ribosomes that\nstall during translation. Key factors working in RQC are the Ltn1/Listerin E3 ubiquitin ligase and its partner,\nNEMF (Rqc2 in yeast). PI Joazeiro has previously found that Ltn1 mutation causes neurodegeneration in mice.\nPI Cox has more recently identified two independent mutations in mouse Nemf causing motor neuron disease\nand used this to knowledge to identify previously undiagnosed patients with a similar neuromuscular condition\nthat inherited causative mutations in the human NEMF gene. In several ways, Ltn1-ENU and Nemf-ENU mice\nphenocopy each other, thus strengthening the connection between RQC dysfunction and neurodegeneration.\nThe proposed studies are aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration\ncaused by NEMF loss of function. We focus our analyses on a recently-discovered activity of NEMF that is\nconserved from bacteria to humans\u2013the modification of aberrant nascent chains with C-terminal Alanine tails\nthat have a proteolytic function. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that NEMF-mediated Ala tailing\nprotects neurons against degeneration. Results of these studies are expected to provide critical understanding\nof how defects in protein quality control lead to neurological disease.",

We have\nidentified the bona fide genetic drivers of these configurations, demonstrated that loss of Trp53 and Brca1 in the\nmouse mammary gland is sufficient to induce tumors with the short-span TDP configuration found in TP53- and\nBRCA1-deficient human cancers, and shown that upon loss of Brca1, TDs are formed through the aberrant\nrepair of stalled replication forks. Here, we propose to deploy a combination of computational analyses, in vivo\nmodelling and in vitro experimentation to achieve a deep mechanistic understanding of how the distinct TDP\ngenomic configurations emerge and impact the course of breast tumorigenesis. Specifically, we will investigate\nthe molecular mechanisms leading to de novo TD formation across the different TDP groups by exploring how\nlocal DNA features associated with DNA replication and fork stalling contribute to the generation of new TDs\nacross a large pan-cancer dataset representing all TDP groups and all TDP genetic drivers (Aim 1A) and how\nloss of BRCA1 activity may modulate the spread and location of the de novo TDs formed in the context of the\nshort-span TDP (Aim 1B). We will establish new genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of breast\ncancer to validate that activation of the Ccne1 pathway or loss of Cdk12 activity, both in conjunction with Trp53\nloss of function, induces medium- and long-span TDP configurations that mimic their human counterparts both\nin terms of TD span size and distribution (Aim 2A) and of the genomic features and genetic elements that are\nassociated with and affected by TD formation (Aim 2B). We will also assess the tumor neo-antigen load of the\nTDP tumors emerging from the newly developed GEMMs and test whether immuno-oncology agents are\neffective against mammary tumors with the TDP configuration, as suggested by recently emerging clinical\nobservations (Aim 2A). We will then use isogenic human cancer cell lines that are either proficient or deficient\nfor BRCA1 activity, to determine the dynamics of de novo TD formation under different modes of cellular\nperturbation and as a function of BRCA1 status (Aim 3A). Finally, we will use the newly developed GEMMs to\nunderstand the evolutionary path to genome-wide TD distribution in the mammary gland, and to discern the\ndynamics of TDP emergence, both in terms of the rate of de novo TD formation and with respect to the timeline\nof breast tumorigenesis (Aim 3B). If successful, this proposal will uncover the root causes of a significant form\nof genomic instability in human cancer, the TDP, define the mutational dynamics leading to cancer formation in\nthis condition, and generate model systems that can lead to the development of new and directed therapeutics\nagainst cancer growth.",

Currently available genetic-engineering approaches, including\nthe CRISPR-Cas9 system, which has revolutionized genome editing, lack the capacity for efficient integration of\nlarge DNA constructs (> 10 kilobases; kb) in mouse zygotes and mouse and human stem cells. This limitation\nsignificantly hinders the modeling of human diseases, including cancer. For example, tandem duplications (TDs),\nsuper-enhancers (SEs; large clusters of transcriptional enhancers), and large non-coding structural variants have\nbeen linked to human diseases, including cancers, but available technologies do not permit modeling such large\nvariants in whole animals or cell lines. To fill this gap, we will develop a gene-editing toolbox that couples the\nprecision of the CRISPR-Cas9 system with the fidelity and efficiency of the serine integrase Bxb1 to enable\nrapid, efficient insertion of large DNA constructs in mice, mouse embryonic stem cells, and human induced\npluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Bxb1 integrase uses DNA attachment sites (attP in the genome, attB in the\ndonor DNA) as substrates for catalyzing efficient transgenesis. We show that our innovative Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox\ncan precisely integrate DNA constructs up to ~43 kb in length in mice. Here, in three aims we will further develop\nand validate the toolbox to enable precise transgenesis of large DNA constructs (~100 kb) and to facilitate\ngeneration of DNA rearrangements. Aim 1: Optimize the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox for insertion of large DNA (10 to\n100 kb) constructs into mouse zygotes. We will use reporter constructs with differing lengths to determine the\nmaximum length of DNA construct that can be inserted efficiently, and will validate a one-step protocol for rapid\ngeneration of transgenic mice without the need to first generate and characterize mice with attachment sites.\nAim 2: Generate mouse and hiPSC models of human diseases, including cancer, using the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox.\nUsing our toolbox to insert large genomic variants, we will generate a mouse model of breast cancer (insertion\nof a 23.7-kb TD), hiPSC model of triple negative breast cancer (27.2-kb SE), and mouse model of Hirschsprung\ndisease (~80-kb human risk allele). Aim 3: Enable use of the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox for generation of DNA\nrearrangements. In cre-lox recombination systems, cre catalyzes recombination between two loxP sites flanking\na target locus, enabling diverse DNA rearrangements. Studies suggest that cre-recombination efficacy is limited\nby the inter-loxP-site distance and the particular genomic site targeted. We will determine whether the Cas9-\nBxb1 toolbox is more efficient than cre-lox for generation of DNA rearrangements, by determining Bxb1-mediated\nrecombination efficacy at different inter-attP/attB distances. Successful completion of this project will provide the\ncommunity with three new models for future studies, and a versatile tool for development of novel and improved\nmouse and hiPSC models of cancer and other diseases.",

Without a better understanding of the genetic and neuronal\nmechanisms that drive AD progression, the development of new therapeutics to enhance cognitive longevity\nwill remain limited. Alternatively, therapeutic strategies to promote cognitive resilience in the face of AD\npathology are potentially effective methods to lessen the impact of AD. To identify gene candidates of\nresiliency I quantified neurodegeneration in the brains of the translationally-relevant AD-BXD mouse model of\nAD via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and used these imaging outcomes to complete genetic mapping. Using\nthis approach, I identified Leucine Rich Repeat And Fibronectin Type III Domain Containing 2 (Lrfn2) as a\npotentially causal gene modifying AD-related cortical neurodegeneration. I hypothesize that Lrfn2\noverexpression will rescue AD-related cortical neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline\nin the 5XFAD model of AD. I will test this hypothesis by developing a novel Lrfn2 overexpression transgenic\nmouse and evaluating the impact of changes in Lrfn2 expression on AD progression in three aims. Aim 1) I will\nmeasure the extent of cortical neurodegeneration in 5XFAD and nontransgenic mice with and without Lrfn2\noverexpression in both male and female mice at 6 and 14 months of age. Results will indicate whether Lrfn2 is\ntruly a causal modifier of cortical neurodegeneration. Aim 2a) To test the impact of Lrfn2 overexpression on\nsynaptic plasticity I will perform ex vivo whole-cell current-clamp electrophysiology recordings in a separate\ncohort of mice. I will determine if overexpression of Lrfn2 in excitatory forebrain neurons rescues long-term\npotentiation deficits in 5XFAD animals. Aim 2b) To investigate the effect of Lrfn2 on synaptic structure, I will\nimage dendritic spines to assess changes in spine morphology and density as a complementary measure of\nsynapse stability and synaptic function associated with cognitive performance. Aim 3) To evaluate the role of\nLrfn2 as a potential resilience factor to cognitive decline, I will execute mouse behavioral tasks measuring\nworking, short-term, long-term, and working memory in the same mice used in Aim 1. To our knowledge, this\nwill be the first study to evaluate Lrfn2 expression in the context of aging, AD, and cortical neurodegeneration.\nWith the successful completion of these aims, I will achieve my long-term goal for this project by determining\nwhether Lrfn2 modulation is a novel resilience therapeutic for AD treatment. The proposed work will facilitate\nthe achievement of my training goals to acquire new skills and knowledge related to IHC, imaging,\nelectrophysiology, dendritic spine characterization, behavioral assays, general wet-lab techniques, and\nprofessional development. Overall, the guidance of Drs. O'Connell and Kaczorowski; access to the outstanding\ncore resources at The Jackson Laboratory; and the experience gained from this fellowship will be a significant\nstep toward achieving my long-term career goal of becoming an independent academic scientist.",

Interrogating this complex\nlandscape of genes and developing community resources around them have traditionally involved modifying the\ngenome on a gene-by-gene and resource-by-resource basis with tremendous effort and at great cost. For\nexample, to create an animal resource containing a knockout of each mouse gene, the International Mouse\nKnockout Consortium has had to target each of 20,000 unique sequences at a combined cost of close to $1\nbillion (USD). Contributing to the funding and labor burden is the fact that each experiment is dependent upon\nthe technically challenging and labor-intensive microinjection of DNAs into fertilized oocytes, or embryonic stem\ncells into early developmental stage mouse blastocysts. Creating even a second, new genome-wide resource\nbased on each of 20,000 genes could conceivably require repeating the costly process yet again.\n To move beyond the one-by-one approach for developing genome-wide resources, outlined/envisioned in\nthis proposal, is a powerful combinatorial technology to sequentially marry functional DNA sequences (encoding,\nfor example, reporters, recombinases, cell-ablating toxins, protein interaction domains, and nucleases) to each\nof thousands of unique mouse genes already marked with a uniform (lacZ-) sequence tag.\n The potential for a breakthrough in genome analysis studies at the heart of the proposal comes from the\ncombination of two powerful and proven technologies \u2014 first, Prime Editing, a CRISPR technology employing\nReverse Transcriptase to insert DNA sequences at points of DNA modification; and second, expression of Prime\nEditing machinery directly from the genome (rather than administering it exogenously).\n The key aspect of the proposed experiments is to exploit the exquisite specificity of Prime Editing to guide\nthe reverse transcription of pegRNA edits/cargoes to multiple, specific, previously (e.g., lacZ-) tagged loci.\nImportantly, successful Prime Editing from specific pegRNAs will afford the opportunity to distribute novel\nfunctional sequences to thousands of mouse genes without any need for the costly, time-consuming\nmicroinjection of zygotes or embryonic stem cells.\n Full implementation of such as system has the potential to accelerate the development, increase the number,\nand decrease the cost of mouse genome-wide resources by orders of magnitude, and to move strain\ndevelopment efforts from a gene-by-gene method to a more massively parallel approach. The combinatorial\nnature of the technology and the adaptability of the system to incorporate the latest in new technological\ndevelopments will allow a longstanding contribution to human health.",

At the cellular level, exercise\nenhances synaptic connectivity and reduces markers of neuroinflammation in aging cortical circuits. Exactly how\nexercise signals in the brain generate these neuroprotective effects remains unknown. Our preliminary\nexperiments have identified a set of neurons in the mouse ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) expressing\nSteroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) that robustly increase their activity in response to exercise. We have found that\nthe VMH SF-1 neural activity signal is potentiated severalfold following repeated exercise, suggesting that the\nexercise signals generated by VMH SF-1 neurons are plastic and shaped by experience. Furthermore, we have\nfound that direct stimulation of SF-1 neurons substantially increases subsequent endurance capacity, suggesting\nVMH Sf-1 neurons are an important neural node controlling the physiological benefits of exercise. However,\nseveral important questions remain unknown. First, which features of VMH SF-1 neurons enables plasticity of\nactivity signals following repeated exercise? Second, which specific sets of VMH SF-1 output neurons transmit\nexercise-relevant signals? Last, is it possible to stimulate VMH SF-1 neurons and generate the neuroprotective\neffects of exercise on cognition and neural circuitry in the aging brain or in AD-like states? The proposed\nexperiments will leverage advanced neuroanatomical and neurophysiological tools with preclinical genetic\nmodels to gain insights into these questions. In Aim 1, we will pair large-volume, high-resolution, and cell-type\nspecific array tomographic neuroanatomical reconstructions with in vivo calcium imaging and neuronal activity\nperturbations to determine how exercise shapes the synaptic architecture of VMH SF-1 neurons. These\nexperiments will define how changes in the synaptic inputs to these neurons might physically `store' exercise\nhistory within VMH circuitry. In Aim 2, we will use advanced viral mapping and in vivo single-cell functional\nimaging techniques to identify which neurons are activated by exercise and understand how these exercise\nsignals are transmitted to specific circuits downstream of the VMH. These experiments will define the\norganization and logic by which exercise-related activity in VMH neurons drives functional changes in the brain.\nIn Aim 3, we will take advantage of advanced preclinical genetic mouse models of early- and late-onset AD to\ndetermine whether stimulating activity in VMH neurons might recapitulate the neuroprotective effects of exercise\nobserved in cortical circuits. These experiments will increase our understanding of how signals in the VMH could\nbe harnessed for therapeutic manipulation in disease states. By leveraging the synergistic expertise of the team\nof investigators assembled to address this problem, insights from these experiments will advance our\nfundamental understanding of how the beneficial effects of exercise are mediated by specific synapses, cell-\ntypes, and circuits, and whether these features are potential therapeutic targets for intervention in disease states.",

However, many questions remain. Namely, are the identified GWA\nhits disease-causing variants or are they simply closely linked markers? And if the GWA hits are disease-causing\nvariants, how do disruptions in these molecules lead to the observed pathologies? Further, since AMD is\nmultifactorial, to what extent do particular combinations of factors precipitate AMD disease phenotypes or\nincrease disease severity, as has been suggested to be the case in large scale GWA studies, where CFH and\nARMS2/HTRA1 (locus on Chr. 10q26) appear to have synergistic effects on disease risk. Together they explain\n>50% of the genetic variability observed in AMD. Furthermore, since ARMS2 and HTRA1 are in strong linkage\ndisequilibrium, it has been difficult to decipher whether either or both genes contribute to AMD-pathologies.\n The issues raised above can be addressed, in part, with appropriate animal models. Although mice do not\nhave a macula per se, they faithfully recapitulate many aspects of retinal degenerative diseases and have been\nused to learn how disruption of certain molecules lead to AMD-like pathologies. In this application, we will seek\nin vivo confirmation of the cell-type and subcellular localization of ARMS2, and establish whether mice bearing\nthe ARMS2A69S allele independently develop AMD-like sub-phenotypes and explore potential molecular\nmechanisms underlying the changes. Finally, because AMD is a multifactorial disease, we will examine if AMD-\nassociated risk factors such as such as diet or genetic variants, such as CFH risk alleles, can potentiate AMD-\nlike disease phenotypes.\n Identifying the pathogenic pathways and mechanisms underlying the disease sub-phenotypes, the goal of\nthis proposal, is critical for developing effective therapies that can target the pre-symptomatic stage to prevent,\ndelay onset or decrease severity of the disease. Animal models serve an important and unique role for furthering\nour understanding of the genetic underpinnings of disease, and as a resource to examine tissue pathology and\nto test therapeutics that cannot be readily done in humans.",

Among children, the heritable disease - Leber Congenital Amaurosis,\naccounts for 20% of blindness, and 10-15%of those are caused by mutations in the CRB1 gene. In addition to\nLCA, CRB1 mutations can also cause congenital or early-onset retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a more slowly\nprogressive disease. CRB1 RP variants are sometimes associated with unique disease features, such as\nretinal telangiectasia with or without exudative retinal detachment (Coat's disease), a loss of RPE pigmentation\nexcept near arterioles (preservation of para-arteriolar RPE or PPRPE), pigment paravenous chorioretinal\natrophy, cone-rod dystrophy, nanophthalmos with optic disc drusen, retinoschisis, cystoid macular edema, and\nmacular dystrophic disease. The cause of the wide range of disease phenotypes associated\nwith CRB1 mutations is not fully understood. Genotype-phenotype correlations that could explain the disease\nspectrum have not been detected among patients bearing CRB1 mutations, suggesting that environmental\nfactors or genetic background modifiers contribute to the variability in the disease phenotypes observed.\nAnother potential contributor to the phenotypic variability in disease presentation are Crb1 isoforms which have\nrecently been shown to have spatially and temporally distinct expression patterns. Clearly, understanding the\nreasons for the variability and the mechanisms underlying the observed pathologies is extremely important for\ndeveloping effective therapies.\nIn this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that pathological changes due to Crb1 mutations depend upon the\nisoform affected and the genetic background on which it occurs, and their potential interactions. We will identify\nthe molecular basis of genetic modifiers that enhance or suppress Crb1rd8 associated disease phenotypes or\nare epistatic upon Crb1rd8. Through the use of mouse models with isoform specific knockout alleles and\ncontrolled genetic backgrounds, we will determine their contribution to disease variability and the mechanisms\nthrough which they function.\nThese studies address a critical unmet need for acquiring the basic biological knowledge necessary to develop\neffective therapies that can target the pre-symptomatic stage to prevent, delay onset or decrease severity of\nthe disease.

Regeneration\nin adult mammals is extremely limited; damaged tissue in most major organs fails to regenerate, and instead\nundergoes scar-based repair. The lack of adult regenerative capacity is an enormous burden on the healthcare\nsystem and society as a whole. Although both human and mouse digit tips can undergo a true regenerative\nresponse, this regeneration is positionally restricted to the terminal distal phalanx bone. Importantly, amputations\nwith an axis point below the terminal distal phalanx bone or too close to the nail bed result in regeneration failure.\nNotably, salamander limbs have an anatomy similar to that of human limbs, but uniquely regenerate after\namputation from any position throughout adult life. The biological mechanisms limiting regeneration in adult\nmammals is poorly understood. Although the immune system is a powerful regulator of wound repair, the exact\nrole of immune-cell networks as a determinant of regenerative success has been grossly understudied. In our\nregeneration studies, including those proposed here, we use the mouse digit-tip model, examining regeneration\nfollowing tissue removal at different digit locations. This is a powerful model, as regeneration can be measured\nnon-invasively with high-resolution micro-computed tomography 3D-imaging (bone/soft tissue volume), and\nanalyzed comprehensively using histology and molecular analysis. We identified several lymphoid immune-cell\ntypes that inhibit mouse digit-tip regeneration via cytotoxic activity against progenitor cells and showed that T-\nregulatory cells (Tregs) play a critical role in protecting progenitors from these cells. We also found that in mice\nlacking lymphoid immunity, novel regeneration is induced, providing new models to identify pro-regenerative\ncells and molecular pathways that can be exploited therapeutically. Importantly, we also identified several\nlymphoid-cell types that support regeneration, suggesting the potential to therapeutically enhance human repair\nthrough targeted immunomodulation. This project aims to identify and characterize the mechanisms by which\nlymphoid cells regulate adult regeneration. Specifically, we will: Aim 1: Dissect and characterize lymphoid-cell\nmechanisms inhibiting regeneration. We will use a range of mouse strains with mutations in cytotoxic function in\nex vivo and in vivo analyses. Aim 2: Define mechanisms of pro-regenerative Treg suppression of lymphoid-cell\ncytotoxicity using Treg-specific deletion of functional genes in vivo. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that targeted\ndisarming of lymphoid cells could enhance regeneration in vivo. We will test tolerogenic molecules in ex vivo\ncytotoxicity assays and then evaluate tolerogenic antigen overexpression in vivo both direct transgenic and viral\napproaches and then via a modified Treg delivery strategy. This project will fuse developmental biology and\nimmunological methods to identify the critical biological pathways and genetic modifiers required for transient\nimmunomodulation strategies directed at inducing latent regenerative potential in adult tissues in mammals. This\nwork will lay the groundwork for translation studies aimed at enhancing tissue repair in human patients.",

Findings in both NOD mice and patients have revealed potential overlap between immune\nresponses targeting pancreatic b-cells and nerves. We hypothesized that lymphocyte populations involved in\nT1D pathogenesis targeting proteins co-expressed in the nervous system may be the earliest responders\ncausing initial damage to peripheral nerves. These first responders provide the necessary trigger to expand\nimmune responses against myelin and other nervous system components traditionally studied in existing\nmouse models of autoimmune neuritis. A vast majority of islet-infiltrating B-lymphocytes in NOD mice respond\nto the nervous-system protein peripherin. Antibodies against phosphorylated peripherin have been identified in\nT1D patients. We recently created a new mouse model (NOD-PerIg) in which B-lymphocytes transgenically\nexpress the immunoglobulin molecule from the peripherin-reactive B-cell clone H280 isolated from islets. T1D\nis accelerated in NOD-PerIg mice. T-cells from NOD-PerIg, but not NOD mice, transfer an autoimmune neuritis\nsimilar to chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) to NOD.scid recipients. This new NOD-PerIg \u00e0\nNOD.scid model of T1D-associated autoimmune neuritis provides an experimental system to directly dissect\nthe discreet stages of nerve cell infiltration and damage. We originally hypothesized that insulitis expanded T-\ncells capable of causing neuritis. However, we have recently determined that T-cells derived from islets or\nsciatic nerves in primary NOD.scid recipients are only capable of infiltrating the organ from which they were\nderived. Therefore, experiments in Aim 1 will address the current unknowns regarding the discrete temporal\nand spatial steps leading to cellular recruitment into peripheral nerves. We have also found that in addition to\nthe presence of IFNg and TNFa producing CD4+ T-cells, there is paradoxically an expansion of T-cells\nnegative for traditional Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines within sciatic nerves. An additional open question is\nwhether peripherin remains the antigen towards which T-cells are responding or whether there has been an\nexpansion of responses against other neuronal antigens. Therefore, studies in Aim 2 will dissect the\nmechanisms by which T-cells destroy peripheral nerves and how an immune response against one shared b-\ncell/neuronal antigen can spill over to a wider neuronal response. Finally, in large NOD colonies, spontaneous\nclinical neuritis can be occasionally observed. We have found that at baseline, NOD mice (around the age of\nT1D onset) already have sciatic nerve infiltrating T-cells. These T-cells are not observed in non-autoimmune\nprone C57BL/6 mice. This indicates the likelihood that NOD harbors genetic loci contributing to spontaneous\nnerve infiltration that can lead to spontaneous neuritis. Whether these loci are distinct or overlapping with loci\ncontributing to T1D is unknown. Therefore, studies in Aim 3 will map genes associated with spontaneous\nnerve infiltration allowing future genetic screening of patients at risk for developing autoimmune neuropathy.",

Here, to test this hypothesis, we will assess BRCA1/2 gene status (BRCA1/2 mutations and BRCA1\npromoter methylation, Specific Aim 1) and levels of the immune-related gene signature (a panel of 30 immune\ngenes, Specific Aim 2) in a retrospective cohort of ~300 primary TNBC samples from women of NHW, NHB\nand Hispanic ancestry. We will then determine the prevalence of the four TNBC prognostic subtypes (BRCAmut,\nBRCA1meth, nonBRCA-ImmuneHigh, nonBRCA-ImmuneLow) within each race/ethnicity towards ascertaining\nwhether their prevalence accounts for differences in response outcomes between NHW and NHB/Hispanic\nTNBC patients. Successful completion of this study will generate novel insight into the basic molecular\nmechanisms underlying cancer health disparities and will provide the groundwork for a future prospective study\nto expand and validate the prognostic value of this type of patient stratification across more refined race and\nethnicity subgroups.",

The program supports , biomedical, biobehavioral, behavioral, and translational research in etiology, pathophysiology, screening, prevention, treatment, and epidemiology of these disorders.\nDown syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) is one of the most common genetic causes of intellectual disability, affecting ~1 in 700 babies in the U.S. each year (1, 2), or an estimated total of ~250,000 Americans living with Down syndrome in 2008 (3). Caused by the presence of 3 copies of chromosome 21 in most individuals, this condition is characterized by multiple organ system involvement in addition to intellectual disability. The molecular and cellular bases of intellectual disability due to Down syndrome have been a topic of intensive study, and murine models of the disease exist.\nThe Repository of Mouse Models for Cytogenetic Disorders (\u201cMouse Repository\u201d) began in the 1970s to generate and distribute mouse models for cytogenetic disorders, with special emphasis on Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21).  The creation of mouse models relevant to DS began in the 1970s and continued with the demonstration of genetic synteny between a segment of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16) and human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), which led to the use of the trisomy 16 mouse (Ts16) as a model for studies relevant to DS.  With the subsequent genetic dissection of both mouse and human genomes, other genes present on Hsa21 were localized to mouse chromosomes 17 and 10 (Mmu17 and Mmu10) as well.   Partial trisomies for a number of syntenic chromosomal segments were generated in the 1980s, under contract to NICHD.  One of these partial trisomies, designated Ts65Dn,  proved  to include  approximately  150  genes  located  in  what  is  considered  the  \u201cDown syndrome critical region\u201d of Hsa21.  Subsequently, these mice were produced and distributed, under an NICHD contract, to investigators approved for receipt of them by NICHD.\nDuring the last 30 years, various investigators have generated other models relevant to DS.  These include, but are not limited to, Ts1Cje, Ts2Cje, Ts1Rhr, Ms1Rhr, Tc1, and others.  When these strains and stocks have been made available to the research community, the creation of a central repository has ensured  their maintenance on appropriate  genetic backgrounds and their distribution  to investigators upon request in a timely manner and subsequent to approval by NICHD. \nMany of these mouse strains are maintained under cryopreservation. In 2010, the NICHD reissued the contract \u201cA Repository of Mouse Models of Cytogenetic Disorders\u201d with a substantial increase in investment to ensure  timely  access  to  and  increased  availability  of  mouse  models  for  cytogenetic disorders, particularly Ts65Dn, to the research community, and to ensure increased experimental efforts to modify the existing genetic backgrounds for the various strains to increase availability and ease of use by investigators. At a workshop \u201cAdvancing Treatment for Alzheimer Disease in Individuals with Down Syndrome\u201d held in April, 2013, the participants from the Alzheimer disease and DS research and advocacy communities expressed concern with the limited availability of existing model systems (other than the Ts65Dn mouse) to the research community at large. Since that meeting, the partial duplication strains Dup(16)Yey, Dup(17)Yey, and Dup(10)Yey have become available and are now part of this Mouse Repository. Each of these strains contains a duplication of one of the 3 mouse chromosome regions that are syntenic to HSA21, with Dup(16)Yey representing the largest number of murine genes syntenic to the human chromosome 21 Mouse models for DS available as of 2017 are reviewed in (4) and see Figure below. More recently, the TcMAC21 \u201chumanized\u201d mouse model of  DS  has  been  created  with  Hsa21  inserted  in  a  mouse  artificial  chromosome  (with  mouse centromere and telomere)\u2014this is stably transmitted so mice have approximately the equivalent of 3 copies of chromosome 21 (2 mouse, one human), and share many features of the human condition (5). With  the  launch  of  the  trans-NIH  INCLUDE  (INvestigation of  Co-occurring  conditions  across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) project in June 2018, there has been a renewed interest in supporting  Down syndrome  research in the domains of  basic science, cohort development, and clinical trials. To support component 1 of the project, which is focused on conducting targeted, high- risk, high-reward basic science studies to understand chromosome 21 biology and the co-occurring conditions in DS, there is a pressing need to ensure the availability of high-quality murine models of the  condition  that  replicate  human  traits.  Combined  with  concerns  about  the  Ts65Dn  model\u2019s limitations with regard to modeling the human trisomy, it is important that new model(s) be added to this Mouse Repository.",

JAX\u2019s research mission focuses on discovering precise genomic solutions for disease to\nimprove human health in the global community. As part of this mission, there has been an increasing emphasis\non the analysis of single cells, as biomedical research has demonstrated that examination of biology at this\nlevel is essential for understanding the biological processes underlying development and disease. Accordingly,\nJAX has technologies for characterization and quantification of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and\nindividual cell-surface protein molecules present, all at the single-cell level. In addition, recently JAX\ninvestigators have had access to increasingly advanced capabilities in the MSPC in mass spectrometry-based\nproteomics and metabolomics for biological discoveries linking genomics with phenotype. However, despite\nour numerous mass spectrometry capabilities, there is currently no instrumentation here with the capability to\nperform unbiased, high-throughput label-free single-cell proteomics analysis. This gap limits our investigators\u2019\nability to understand biology at the single-cell level, including new insights that would be gained by integrating\nsingle-cell proteome data with the array of other single-cell data generated here, and by addressing the issue\nof a generally weak transcriptome-proteome correlation in organisms. The Bruker timsTOF SCP mass\nspectrometer is the ideal system to address this gap. This instrument offers innovative technologies, including\na dramatically improved ion-source concept, an enhanced trapped ion mobility, and mass analyzer that provide\nultra-high sensitivity, enabling unbiased single-cell proteomics with high reproducibility. The timsTOF SCP can\nachieve coverage of about 1,500 proteins per cell, sufficiently identify post-translational modifications in a very\nsmall number of morphologically or functionally similar cells, and efficiently analyze low-abundant samples,\nsuch as the rare cell populations that many of our investigators study. The timsTOF SCP and its accessories,\nincluding the cellenONE for single-cell sorting and proteomic sample processing, will be transformative for\nresearch at JAX and other Maine research institutions. Various studies at JAX focused on rare immune-cell\npopulations, stem-cell differentiation, sub-populations of cancer cells, the identification of new therapeutic\ntargets for cancer, and characterizing mechanisms underlying cognitive aging will all benefit from this\ninstrumentation. Progress in these research areas are particularly important given JAX\u2019s broadening emphasis\non translating our basic research discoveries into clinical advances that will directly benefit human health. In\nsum, the Bruker timsTOF SCP platform will substantially enhance JAX\u2019s ability to fulfill its research mission and\nwill also bring this potential to the greater Maine community.",

This view informs most approaches to drug discovery, where an ideal\ntherapeutic would target nuclear processes to induce pluripotency and proliferation to heal a wound or inhibit\npluripotency and proliferation in cancer. Often overlooked are somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments that\ndefinitively show cellular potential is also a product of the cytoplasm, specifically, the cytoplasm of germ cells.\nThe long-term objectives of this research are to understand how cellular pluripotency and regenerative capacity\nare retained in germ cells through their specialized cytoplasm. We expect these findings to inform and expand\napproaches to drug discovery and lead to therapeutics that function by targeting the cytoplasmic milieu.\n Cytoplasmic processes unique to germ cells often occur in protein/RNA assemblies that reside on or near\nthe nuclear periphery. These assemblies are collectively called germ granules. Because core germ-granule\ncomposition is conserved from nematodes to humans, we can use C. elegans nematodes to visualize germ\ngranules in vivo and to expedite studies into their function. Mutations that displace or severely disrupt germ\ngranules in C. elegans cause sterility and germline-to-somatic reprogramming. In this proposal, we look at the\nearliest events of somatic reprogramming to determine how processes within germ granules antagonize this fate.\nWe investigate the contribution of glycine-rich repeat motifs to the specialized germ-granule microenvironment.\nWe then describe two novel interactions with a core germ-granule protein called GLH-1 (DDX4 in humans). One\nof these interactions with GLH-1 likely facilitates the hand-off of mRNAs from germ granules to initiate translation.\nThe other is a dynamic interaction with GLH-1 that activates a conserved cellular pathway to trigger engulfment\nby surrounding soma. Lastly, we follow up on another core germ-granule protein that we named LOTR-1\n(TDRD5/7 in humans) and its LOTUS-domain-dependent interaction with a 3\u2019UTR binding complex. Together,\nthese findings will provide an understanding of cytoplasmic processes within germ granules that ensure the\npluripotent potential of germ cells.",

Every human suffers fibrotic scarring in their lifetime, and fibrosis accounts for over 45% of human deaths, due to organ failure. Thus, there is a great need for therapies that improve wound healing and tissue regeneration. While the regenerative-biology field has grown exponentially over recent decades, largely due to technical advances such as CRISPR and next-generation sequencing, this growth has not seen corresponding growth in the workforce. We believe that the best approach to develop such a workforce is to train scientists using a cross-species approach, enabling them to understand regeneration by studying organisms that differ in regeneration capacity to identify common and distinct tissue-regeneration processes. A knowledge of regeneration also requires an understanding of the unique developmental biology across these organisms. Our program is designed for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career scientists. We will implement our program via three aims. In Aim 1 we will offer an annual ten-day research training course and networking symposium focused on the inter-relationship between regenerative and developmental-biology research. The course will include hands-on laboratory training using animal models that differ in regeneration capacity; keynote lectures and other activities designed to promote interactions among Program participants; bioinformatics, microscopy, and Responsible Conduct of Research training; and a half-day weekend symposium to provide course participants and ReBilD Program alumni with opportunities to network and present their research. In Aim 2 we will establish a year-round Visiting Scientist Program enabling course alumni and other researchers to spend up to four weeks at MDIBL and work alongside our lab members to receive additional, focused research training using advanced methodologies such as transgenesis on one or more of the model organisms used in the 10-day course. In Aim 3 we will establish a sustainable community of interdisciplinary ReBilD researchers, by establishing strong mentoring for all participants and creating an online networking forum that will provide multiple resources such as course materials to ReBilD Program students, faculty, invited speakers, and other regeneration/developmental biology researchers, and will create an online networking and discussion forum for long-term, post-program interactions, including mentoring, and for further expanding this community. Our program will also include annual mid-year career-development and grant-writing workshops; a seminar series in regeneration and development; and an outcome-assessment plan. Together, the elements of our ReBilD Program will create a workforce well-positioned to make discoveries in their own laboratories and to further expand this research community.",

                                    "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nArsenic exposure from well water and food is a major public health concern. Early life (e.g., prenatal) exposure\nto low level arsenic increases risk of developing psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety in\nadulthood. Arsenic is an endocrine disruptor and available evidence suggests that its psychopathological effects\nstem from interference with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling; however, gaps remain in our understanding\nof the underlying mechanisms. Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 9 (Klf9) is a transcription factor important for neurogenesis\nand metabolic regulation and is a regulatory hub at the junction of multiple endocrine and cellular stress signaling\npathways. KLF9 has been implicated in stress-induced psychopathology and neurodegeneration. We and others\nhave shown that Klf9 is a feedforward regulator of GR signaling. We have obtained preliminary data indicating\nthat the GR-Klf9 gene regulatory pathway is perturbed in zebrafish embryos exposed to low-level arsenic, This\nexploratory/developmental research project will use zebrafish as a model system to test the hypothesis that\nchronic early life exposure to low levels of arsenic increases risk of depression and/or other psychiatric disorders\nby developmentally altering homeostatic setpoints to persistently impede GR- and/or Klf9-dependent stress\nresponsivity, resulting in long-term loss of plasticity and dysfunction. Zebrafish are an ideal model system for the\nproposed studies as they share all the relevant genes and neuroendocrine signaling pathways with humans, and\nare social, diurnal animals with complex behaviors that can be measured and related to human psychology and\nstress-responsive behavior. Moreover, the larvae provide unsurpassed access for experimental manipulation\nand observation, and transgenic reporter lines for monitoring GR and brain activity by fluorescence microscopy.\nThe proposed research will use those tools, as well as a klf9 and GR-knockout lines that we recently created\nusing CRISPR, to accomplish two specific aims. The first is to determine if chronic exposure to arsenic results\nin long-term glucocorticoid resistance and increased neuroinflammation. To that end we will assess the effects\nof chronic arsenic exposure during early development on basal and stress-induced activity of GR target genes\nand inflammation markers in larvae and adult brain tissue, as well as on larval and adult cortisol levels. The\nsecond specific aim is to determine if chronic developmental exposure to low level arsenic results in aberrant\nbrain activity and behaviors. To accomplish this, we will use fluorescence microscopy and automated movement\ntracking to ask how chronic developmental exposure to low-level arsenic affect brain development, basal and\nstress-responsive neuronal activity in parts of the larval brain that regulate neuroendocrine stress signaling, and\nbehavior of the exposed larvae across the lifespan. The project will open a new avenue for future research\nfocused on the mechanisms underlying the the pathophysiological effects of early life arsenic exposure on the\nneuroendocrine stress system.",

                                    "project_description": "ABSTRACT/SUMMARY (30 lines):\nThe Communicating Data project engages secondary school teachers and students from both rural and urban\nareas in Maine and New Hampshire as citizen scientists in collecting both private and public drinking water\nsamples for heavy metal analysis and communicating their findings with a goal of improving public health in their\ncommunities. This new project will build on our current SEPA project which has a focus on arsenic in private\nwell water in rural communities. Based on what we are learning in our first project, that nearly all communities\nhave a mix of some public water systems as well as private wells, we will provide a more inclusive experience\nfor students by having them collect home drinking water samples for analysis, no matter what the source. We\nwill provide curriculum on drinking water systems so that students can identify their source of drinking water.\nWhile our first project focused on arsenic in wells, many schools found that uranium and lead and other\ncontaminants were also issues that need attention. So, we will develop curriculum that addresses multiple\ndrinking water contaminants and provide training for teachers in these areas. We have already developed data\nliteracy tools and curriculum that will serve teachers and students in this new project. With these supports in\nplace, our new SEPA project will focus on helping students create data visualizations so that they can more\neffectively communicate their findings to diverse audiences. We know from surveys of homeowners who\ncontributed well water samples in the first years of our current project, that the likelihood of mitigating arsenic in\ndrinking water was related to the extent of parent-child interactions in the home. To further support these\ninteractions, we will also focus on intergenerational learning. In guided focus sessions with parents, we will get\ntheir input on developing appropriate at-home conversation prompts and sink-side activities to engage families\nmore actively in understanding the importance of healthy drinking water. We anticipate that this approach,\ncombined with our expanded focus on multiple contaminants in drinking water from homes dependent on either\nprivate or public drinking water sources in either urban or rural environments will enable us to more broadly\ndisseminate our project and facilitate its replicability in other geographic areas.\n.",

During\nresuscitation of neonates, a HALO event, rapid access to appropriately equipped and trained medical\npersonnel capable of delivering time-sensitive medical interventions is essential, or the consequences\nare dire, including mortality and significant morbidity. The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP\u00ae), a\nnational guideline and training program, designed to standardize care and improve adherence to care\nalgorithms, is delivered every two years. However, knowledge and technical skills involved in\nadherence to best practices typically degrade over two to three months if the skills are not used\nclinically. For high-volume, urban teaching hospitals, there is sufficient volume to maintain skills. For\nlower volume rural and community hospitals, there is a lack of opportunities to maintain skills,\nincluding Maine, where neonatal resuscitation is a true HALO event with the vast majority of hospitals\ndelivering less than one infant a day and very few newborns needing any resuscitation. High volume\ncenters across various populations have better outcomes, and in emergencies, patients in lower\nvolume centers experience higher rates of medication errorsand differences in adherence to care\nalgorithms. Studies estimate that 20-40% of neonatal lives could be saved with proper neonatal\nresuscitation and are dependent upon a rapid, knowledgeable, and skillful response. There is an\nurgent need to increase rural community hospital readiness and solutions to improve neonatal HALO\nrelated care delivery. The overall goal of the parent grant, the NIH COBRE in Acute Care Research\nand Rural Disparities, is to support and develop strategies to reduce health disparities due to rurality.\nThis supplement grant proposal seeks to decrease the healthcare disparities experienced by rural\npatients by targeting team-based performance training for neonatal resuscitation. We aim to conduct\na pilot crossover study comparing team performance in NRP\u00ae, teamwork, and communication skills\nwith HoloBabyTM (a novel mixed reality neonatal manikin prototype) and HiFi manikin simulation. We\nwill compare team performance in simulations using HoloBabyTM and HiFi training. Simulations will be\nvideo recorded and investigators will rate NRP\u00ae adherence, teamwork, and communication using\nstandardized scoring tools. We hypothesize teams\u2019 performance with the different simulation\ntechnologies will be equivalent. We also aim to evaluate the psychometric properties of the modified\nNRP\u00ae adherence assessment tool. We will use data collected in Aim 1, in addition to existing\nassessment data, to examine estimates of reliability and validity for the NRP\u00ae assessment tool. We\nhypothesize the modified NRP\u00ae assessment tool is a sufficiently valid and reliable tool for measuring\nteam performance in the simulated environment and will not differ according to simulator type.\nTo achieve our proposed aims, a diverse skill set, expertise, and team approach will be essential.\nThis project aims to leverage simulation expertise, including the neonatal simulation expertise of Drs.\nZanno and Melendi and the pediatric simulation experience of Dr. Mallory. The project will utilize\nsimulation expertise through the Hannaford Center for Safety, Innovation, and Simulation (HCSIS), a\nhigh throughput simulation center for MaineHealth that reaches approximately 5,000 clinicians per\nyear across Maine. Dr. Strout has extensive training and experience in the conduct of clinical and\neducational research across the lifespan, which includes qualitative, quantitative, and mixed\nmethodologies as well as psychometrics and measure development and evaluation. Together, this\nteam is poised to successfully achieve the aims proposed here, advancing scientific understanding in\nthis area and improving neonatal care delivery in rural communities.",

Our focus on developing basic biomedical\nresearch to support translational programs has been supported by the formation of Centers of Biomedical\nResearch Excellence (2000-present), and in 2017, a multi-institute Northern New England Clinical and\nTranslational Research Network to establish infrastructure required for extending clinical research efforts. We\nhave maintained a focus on medical training programs, with prominent academic affiliations with Tufts\nUniversity School of Medicine, with 40 of their medical students in a Maine Track program and 20 ongoing\nresidency and fellowship programs. Of note, recent expansions in graduate medical education include the\naddition of a Rural Track in our Internal Medicine residency, and an enhanced focus on research as part of\nresidency and fellowships. These efforts have been bolstered by institutional investments to support medical\nstudents and physicians in expanded options for research, and the alignment of research mentors with these\ncommitments. Research and clinical strengths at Maine Medical Center include topics of high relevance to the\nmission of the NHLBI, including vessel wall biology, vascular development, myocardial injury, heart failure,\nvascular progenitor cells, vascular inflammation, adipose/vascular interactions, endothelial dysfunction and\ncardiovascular disease; and clinical research addressing cardiac arrest, cystic fibrosis, hemorrhagic shock,\nvascular complications of trauma, and genetics/epidemiology of disease.

Our Center in Phase I developed a critical mass of investigators with biomedical research interests in metabolic health and disease, focusing on adipose tissue, bone and skeletal biology, and environmental, neural, and pharmacological inputs that regulate these tissues. Our COBRE also supported three scientific core facilities \u2013 Physiology, Histopathology, and Proteomics and Lipidomics cores. These scientific core facilities provide outstanding services, and have responsibility for maintaining state-of-the-art technologies in their respective areas by updating technology, equipment, and maintaining current knowledge. In addition, scientific core facilities are responsible for the training of staff, and assisting in experimental design, project implementation and data analysis. We established a robust mentoring network for our junior investigators, and engaged an external advisory committee to evaluate projects, cores, and our overall Center. Our investment in Phase I COBRE projects and pilot projects thus far has directly yielded six NIH R01 awards (original four junior investigator project leads were funded) with seven COBRE members, one NSF CAREER award, one NIH S10 instrumentation grant, and one foundation research grant. Two COBRE members also mentor PhD students who were awarded NIH F31 fellowships during this time. In year four of Phase I, we held a national faculty recruitment that yielded two outstanding new junior investigators who joined our COBRE; one in August 2021 (Matt Lynes PhD), and one in August 2022 (Ziru Li PhD). In addition to Drs. Lynes and Li, Phase II supports a third new junior investigator project lead, Dr. Isha Agarwal. These new project leads bring expertise in thermogenic adipocytes, a gut-bone signaling axis, and impact of night shift work on diabetes risk in pregnant women. Our Phase II program will build upon our successful leadership, mentorship and professional development model. We will focus on expanding our portfolio of research and scientific resources under the guidance of an Advisory Committee. Goals for Phase II of this COBRE in Metabolic Networks are: 1) Provide leadership to evolve a robust Center infrastructure with administrative, fiscal and scientific management to support growth of collaborative research and resources in metabolic health and disease, 2) Support career advancement for COBRE investigators and alumni, and 3) Maintain high quality shared scientific resources. Successful achievement of these goals will support professional development of promising junior investigators while expanding the use of well-regarded scientific shared research resources, which are already highly utilized by a researcher user base throughout the country.",

This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text.\nThe goal of this Transdisciplinary Predoctoral Training Program is to provide future scientists and engineers with a uniquely integrative education to facilitate their development as innovative transdisciplinary scientists. The Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering (GSBSE) at the University of Maine is an ideal home for this transdisciplinary T32. GSBSE is a statewide biomedical science and engineering PhD program that encompasses not only UMaine, but also the Jackson Laboratory, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, MaineHealth Institute for Research, and the University of New England. Thus, the GSBSE leverages the expertise and infrastructure of the state\u2019s premier biomedical research programs. GSBSE significantly contributes to Maine\u2019s burgeoning focus on bioscience by nucleating new collaborations within and between GSBSE institutions. With 150 faculty and 90 students, the GSBSE\u2019s research mission is broad and spans the areas of computational biology, cell and molecular biology, and general medical sciences. The GSBSE emphasizes transdisciplinary collaboration and skills required for team science to prepare students for future biomedical research. The 2019-2024 T32 Transdisciplinary Predoctoral Training Program in Biomedical Science and Engineering, UMaine\u2019s first T32, has been very successful. It supported 17 trainees for their first and second years, with 5 subsequently receiving F31 grants. This renewal includes 64 funded faculty members who are committed to transdisciplinary research, full support of partner institutes who provide resources and commitment to predoctoral trainees, a strong foundational curriculum in the biomedical sciences integrated with engineering principles, and advisory committees to oversee and evaluate program outcomes. This program will be administered at the University of Maine and incorporates a multiple PI model. Drs. Gregory Cox (Director, GSBSE), Clarissa Henry (Professor, University of Maine) and Lucy Liaw (Faculty Scientist, MaineHealth Institute for Research) all have significant mentorship, administrative, and leadership experience. This T32 proposes to provide support for 8 predoctoral students in their second and third years of study, all of whom will receive the enhanced training strategies described in this proposal.",

Adipocytes have functional specificity based\non their molecular phenotype; white adipocytes store energy in the form of lipids (white adipose tissue), and\nthermogenic adipocytes burn calories and generate heat (beige and brown adipose tissue). Within the vascular\nmicroenvironment, blood vessels are surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) that impacts vascular\nfunction. In the mouse, PVAT surrounding the thoracic aorta are brown-like, with high levels of thermogenic\nmarkers, and a clear association with vascular reactivity and vascular disease progression. In humans, aortic\nPVAT appears similar to human subcutaneous white adipose tissue, with unilocular adipocytes displaying a\nlipid storage phenotype. However, we identified thermogenic markers within human aortic PVAT, and\nmolecular differences are established between human PVAT from healthy versus diseased vasculature. The\nability to increase the proportion of thermogenic versus white adipose tissue in the body has been suggested\nto be an anti-obesity therapeutic strategy, and increasing thermogenesis of PVAT is predicted to be protective\nagainst vascular disease. Thus, it is critical to understand molecular determinants of adipocyte thermogenesis\nin humans. In collaborative work, we recently defined novel lineages of thermogenic adipocytes that were\nfunctionally tested in mice. These lineages, interestingly, included a smooth muscle cell (SMC) like adipocyte\nlineage, which is relevant to PVAT, which is directly adjacent to the vessel wall. We hypothesize that the\nsmooth muscle cell-like adipocyte lineage in human PVAT contributes directly to the thermogenic adipocyte\nlineage in humans, and that the functional activity of this lineage inversely correlates to vascular disease\nprogression. This is a translational study with the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the molecular identity\nof the adipocyte progenitor cells in human PVAT, and cellular PVAT composition in vascular pathology. We will\nperform molecular studies to identify sub-populations of adipocyte progenitors and overall cellular composition\nin human PVAT, and identify associations with clinical and physiological measures of health and disease. Aim\n2. Identify the mechanisms driving functional capacity thermogenic adipocyte differentiation in human\nadipocyte progenitors, and impact on vascular smooth muscle cell physiology. Differentiation capacity will be\ntested in the fibroblast progenitor population and the SMC-like progenitor population, and paracrine signaling\nfrom adipocytes will be evaluated using human vascular SMC. Novel pathways identified from molecular\nstudies will inform studies to determine drivers of thermogenic differentiation. Our results are expected to\nidentify for the first time molecular signatures of PVAT corresponding to different vascular pathologies, and\ncharacterize critical adipocyte progenitor populations related to the differentiation of thermogenic adipocytes in\nhuman progenitor cells.",

Our COBRE also supported\nthree scientific core facilities \u2013 Physiology, Histopathology, and Proteomics and Lipidomics cores. These\nscientific core facilities provide outstanding services, and have responsibility for maintaining state-of-the-art\ntechnologies in their respective areas by updating technology, equipment, and maintaining current knowledge.\nIn addition, scientific core facilities are responsible for the training of staff, and assisting in experimental design,\nproject implementation and data analysis. We established a robust mentoring network for our junior\ninvestigators, and engaged an external advisory committee to evaluate projects, cores, and our overall Center.\nOur investment in Phase I COBRE projects and pilot projects thus far has directly yielded six NIH R01 awards\n(including funding of the original four junior investigator project leads) with seven COBRE members, one NSF\nCAREER award, one NIH S10 instrumentation grant, and one foundation research grant. Two COBRE\nmembers also mentor PhD students who were awarded NIH F31 fellowships during this time. In year four of\nPhase I, we held a national faculty recruitment that yielded two outstanding new junior investigators who joined\nour COBRE; one in August 2021 (Matt Lynes PhD), and one in August 2022 (Ziru Li PhD). In addition to Drs.\nLynes and Li, Phase II includes support for a third new junior investigator project lead, Dr. Isha Agarwal. These\nnew project leads bring expertise in thermogenic adipocytes, a gut-bone signaling axis, and impact of night\nshift work on diabetes risk in pregnant women. Our Phase II program will build upon our successful leadership,\nmentorship and professional development model. We will focus on expanding our portfolio of research and\nscientific resources under the guidance of an Advisory Committee. Goals for Phase II of this COBRE in\nMetabolic Networks are: 1) Provide leadership to evolve a robust Center infrastructure including administrative,\nfiscal and scientific management to support growth of collaborative research and resources in metabolic health\nand disease, 2) Support career advancement for COBRE investigators and alumni, 3) Maintain high quality\nshared scientific resources, and 4) Build a diverse research community that is guided by principles of diversity,\ninclusion, and equity. Successful achievement of these goals will support professional development of\npromising junior investigators while expanding the use of well-regarded scientific shared research resources,\nwhich are already highly utilized by a researcher user base throughout the country.",

It will create training opportunities for medical students, especially in spectral flow cytometry,\nthrough MHIR's T35 program. Maine Medical Center's commitment to supporting and enhancing core\nfacilities, especially the Flow Cytometry Core, is evident through substantial financial investments, ongoing\nfunding support, strategic planning efforts, and a pledge of over $2 million over the next five years to ensure\nthe continued success of all its core facilities. This dedication reflects the institution's commitment to\nfostering cutting-edge biomedical research and sustaining a thriving research ecosystem. The\nimplementation of high-dimensional flow cytometry will significantly enhance the scope and depth of\nbiomedical research at MHIR. These projects collectively aim to unravel the complex cellular and molecular\nmechanisms involved in various health-related phenomena, spanning from immune responses following\nresuscitation after cardiac arrest to the prevention of bone loss in post-menopausal women. The cytometer\nenables precise characterization of cell populations and their functional states, facilitating the identification\nof key contributors to tissue damage, inflammatory cascades, mitochondrial function, and drug resistance,\nthereby deepening our understanding of underlying biological processes and paving the way for developing\nnovel therapeutic strategies across diverse health conditions. Ultimately, the integration of high-dimensional\nflow cytometry enhances the institution's capacity to address complex health challenges and drive\ntransformative discoveries in biomedical science. In summary, the addition of the BD FACSymphony A5 SE\nto MHIR will significantly benefit Maine's research community by driving scientific innovation, attracting\nfunding, and fostering economic and educational growth. It will elevate research capabilities, support the\ndevelopment of COBRE projects, empower project leaders to acquire preliminary data for independent\nfunding, and enhance training opportunities for future scientists. Moreover, it will enhance operational\nefficiency and maintain competitiveness in high-dimensional flow cytometry research, ensuring that MHIR\nremains at the forefront of biomedical research.",

                                    "project_description": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThe obesity epidemic is a global public health issue, that leads to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and\ncardiovascular disease. Hypertrophy, inflammation, and excess lipid accumulation in white adipocytes within\nfat tissue are hallmarks of obesity that contribute to metabolic dysfunction. Unlike white adipocytes, beige\nadipocytes are rich in mitochondria, and expend energy to generate heat (thermogenesis) in response to\nstimuli such as cold exposure. This activity is associated with resistance to diet-induced obesity, and thus\nactivation and expansion of beige adipocytes can counteract the obesity phenotype. During beige adipocyte\nactivation, optimal thermogenic function is maintained by balancing mitochondrial biogenesis with autophagy-\nmediated mitochondrial degradation (mitophagy), which is finely coordinated to maintain mitochondrial\nhomeostasis. Using our newly developed model of beige adipocyte differentiation and activation from human\niPS cells, we discovered that thermogenic activation of beige adipocytes occurs following enhanced secretion\nof exosomes containing a variety of microRNAs (miRs), including miR-27a/b. miR-27 homologs (miR-27a/b)\nare anti-thermogenic miRs that suppress genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (such as FOXJ3) and\nmitophagy (including MFF). miR-27a/b are down-regulated in beige adipocytes during thermogenic activation,\nconsistent with their predicted role as inhibitors of mitochondrial activation, turnover, and biogenesis. This\nproject tests several hypotheses related to mechanisms of beige adipocyte activation. We propose that the\nmiR-27 suppresses adipocyte thermogenesis by targeting FOXJ3 and MFF and that loss of miR-27a/b and\nincrease in FOXJ3/MFF-mediated pathways activate mitochondrial activity and thermogenesis. We also\npropose that in vivo genetic targeting of miR-27a/b will allow us to identify the in vivo role of these miRs in\nbeige adipocyte activation, regulation of mitochondrial proteins, thermogenesis and resistance to obesity.\nThese questions will be tested in two focused specific aims:\nSpecific Aim 1. Identify the mechanism of miR-27 regulation of beige adipocyte mitochondrial function.\nSpecific Aim 2. Determine the effect of miR-27 suppression on the response of beige adipose tissue to\ntemperature challenge and high-fat diet.\nThese studies are expected to identify novel molecular mechanisms that may provide a new platform to\nincrease beige adipogenesis and reverse obesity-related disorders.",

In 2018, it is estimated there will be 8,600 new adult cancer cases diagnosed in Maine; cancer is the most common cause of death in our state. Of these adult cases, 6,185 (72%) will receive their care at a MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) hospital or outpatient facility. This patient volume is akin to any major metropolitan cancer center. With only 1.3 million residents, Maine is a small state, is the most rural state, and has the oldest population in the nation. There are significant cancer risk behaviors and exposures, and there are numerous socioeconomic and geographic challenges as well, further compounding our cancer burden. The MHCCN is clearly organized around patient, health provider, and healthcare system multi-tiered strategies and interventions that are prioritized in the NCORP solicitation and defended in this proposal. Our health system embarked upon a comprehensive oncology strategic planning process in 2014 that in a relatively short period has led to the opportunity to submit our response to this FOA. Consensus was reached on the model of cancer care that we would pursue. The singular goal is to ensure that \"the right care, in the right location, as close to home as possible\" will be provided. Cancer patients in our state and their families desire access to state-of-the-art patient-centered care. This NCORP application could not come at a more auspicious time for our organization, coinciding with significant growth and substantive multi-million dollar investment in MH Oncology over the past couple years. With this backdrop, the fundamental goal of our application is to commit and contribute to a robust slate of NCORP activities across the lifespan including pediatric, adolescent and young adults, adults, and elderly cancer patients in our communities and rural care settings. We have assembled a highly interactive and interdisciplinary team across our network to participate in and lead this research endeavor. Our central hypothesis is that developing a highly interactive and interdisciplinary approach to cancer care that is at all times patient-centered throughout MH Oncology will have salutary effects on all aspects of our cancer care across the continuum of prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, end-of-life, and care delivery not only for our patients and their families but for other aspects critical to our mission \u2013 including educating the next generation of healthcare providers and expanding our research pursuits especially in rural areas within our care network. We propose 4 aims: To conduct and actively participate in 1) cancer control research, 2) cancer prevention research, and 3) cancer care delivery research studies; and 4) to capitalize upon clinical research opportunities afforded by NCORP and our newly awarded Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network grant (1U54 GM115517). We will pursue these aims across the lifespan engaging both children and adults. The MHCNN has every expectation that will we make substantive contributions across the spectrum of the NCORP research portfolio. We will capitalize on our institutional assets, patient resources, and expertise from the vantage point of community and rural settings to add value across the lifespan and provide leadership to the NCORP.

My parental R37 focuses\non examining how fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) impact multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable blood\ncancer that results from mutations that accumulate in the plasma cell. Myeloma cells grow in the rich soil of the\nbone marrow (BM), first very slowly, and then more quickly and aggressively, causing degradation of the bone\nand development of drug resistant clones. Although therapies exist, novel approaches to myeloma therapy are\nneeded. Our prior work suggested that myeloma cells can become drug resistant and proliferate faster through\nsupport from proteins called fatty acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FABP4 and FABP5). In Specific Aim 1 of our\nparent award, we are analyzing how BM adipocytes and the FABPs contribute to myeloma by using novel,\nthree-dimensional (3D), tissue engineered cancer models as well as FABP inhibition methods. In Specific Aim\n2, we use mouse models to study the roles of the FABP members in MM, as well as the roles of BM\nadipocytes. The long-term goal of our work is to understand molecules and mechanisms driving MM growth;\nthis Extension and Parent project specifically will identify new mediators driving MM and propose paradigm-\nshifting concepts to guide the development of new anti-MM therapies. The proposed studies in this Extension\nbuild on our prior and ongoing work in the Parent award, and add complementary data and translational\nsignificance to the findings. Both Extension Aims will be used to identify translationally significant effects and\nmechanisms of FABP actions on tumor cells and on the tumor immune microenvironment. Our Extension\nSpecific Aim 1 is to Create FABP5 and FABP6 knockdown (KD) MM cells and phenotype these cells in\nvitro & in vivo. Our Extension Specific 2 is to Investigate the effects of obesity on MM growth and drug\nresistance, and the roles of FABPs in this process using FABP inhibitors and Fabp4/5dKO in vivo\nmodels. This Extension will explore the roles of the FABPs in MM cell growth, survival, and drug resistance in\nvitro and in vivo using oral administration of the FABP inhibitor BMS309403 and using a FABP4/5dKO (double\nhomozygous knockout) mouse model. Analyses of tumor and non-tumor BM microenvironment cells, as well\nas mouse serum, blood, and other tissues are intended to illuminate the actions of FABP inhibition not only on\ntumor cells, but also on surrounding cells and the mouse overall. This work in thoroughly understanding the\npotential roles and mechanisms of action for the FABPs in MM is essential in moving towards clinical use.",

                                    "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSocial isolation is a potent form of psychosocial stress, and a growing public health concern. Older adults,\nparticularly those individuals isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic, are particularly vulnerable. One in four\nindividuals over the age of 65 are estimated to be affected by social isolation and loneliness, which are\nassociated with an increase in mortality risk by up to 70%. Previous studies have shown other forms of\npsychosocial stress and mental illness are associated with increased risk for osteoporosis and related\nfractures, which are likewise associated with increased mortality in older adults. Despite the increase in social\nisolation and the overlap between at-risk populations, there has been little research on the effects of social\nisolation on bone loss and skeletal metabolism. The limited work that has been done in rodents suggest that\nsocial isolation negatively impacts bone health, leading to decreased bone mineral density. None of these\nstudies, however, have explored the mechanisms of isolation-induced bone loss, or examined differences in\nthe effect of isolation on bone between the sexes. My own preliminary studies show that males exposed to\nsocial isolation had reduced femoral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and cortical thickness.\nFemales, conversely, did not have any reduction in bone mass. My data also showed changes to\nglucocorticoid receptor and \u03b22 adrenergic receptor expression as a result of social isolation, which both have\nknown effects on bone. The goal of this project is therefore to test the overarching hypothesis that social\nisolation leads to bone loss through altered glucocorticoid (Aim 1) and sympathetic nervous system (Aim 2)\nactivity. I will test these hypotheses using a 4 to 8-week-long mouse model of social isolation in 16-week old\nmice, in combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches. I will also use proteomic and microRNA\nsequencing approaches to identify novel systemic changes in response to social isolation that may impact\nbone. The proposed project will be the first study to identify mediating mechanisms of social isolation-induced\nbone loss and precisely test the effects of isolation on bone metabolism through a range of imaging, genetic,\nhistologic, and omic approaches. The results of this project will inform future clinical and epidemiological\nstudies, and help identify prevention strategies and treatments for individuals at the greatest risk for social\nisolation.",

                                    "project_description": "Endocrine diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and thyroid conditions exhibit relatively\u00a0high heritability according\u00a0to epidemiological\u00a0and familial studies, but genetic mutations identified\u00a0to date can only explain a very small proportion of clinical cases. This gap raises the possibility that abnormal epigenetic information, elicited by environmental circumstances and transmitted between generations, significantly contribute to the missing heritability of these conditions. In this regard, thyroid abnormalities are very prevalent in humans, but studies defining the consequences for endocrine pathophysiology in the children and descendants of affected individuals are sorely lacking. Based on preliminary observations on\u00a0a mouse model of developmental thyrotoxicosis due to functional loss of the type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) and subsequent impairment in thyroid hormone clearance, we hypothesize that developmental paternal thyrotoxicosis causes in the offspring a broad and complex syndrome affecting the regulation of energy balance and multiple endocrine systems of relevance to obesity and type 2 diabetes, including including the thyroid axis, the leptin-melanocortin system and insulin-glucose homeostasis. Preliminary data indicate that this syndrome, which we termed \"SOFT\" for \"Syndrome Of Father's Thyrotoxicosis\", exhibits sexually dimorphic severity, and features obesity, aberrant insulin-glucose homeostasis, altered physiological responses to fasting a a high fat diet, and abnormalities in molecular markers of the thyroid axis, and leptin-melanocortin and ghrelin systems.\u00a0 The aims of the project will further characterize SOFT, establish its molecular and physiological basis, and define how it is paternally trasnmitted and generated in the offspring. Aim 1 will determine the role of neonatal leptin in the generation of SOFT. We will test whether the blunted peak of neonatal leptin exihibited by the offspring of thyrotoxic fathers is responsible for the abnormal endocrine programming characteristic of adult mice with SOFT. Aim 2 will determine the role of paternal Thra in the generation of SOFT. We will test whether the establishment of an altered germ line epigenome in thyrotoxic fathers and the developmental abnormalities and generation of SOFT in their offspring requires the mediation of the alpah sioform of the thyroid hormone receptor. We anticipate our work will generate a novel paradigm for the non-genetic but heritable etiology and susceptibility to endocrine conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and thyroid disease. This heritability would be dependent on a paternal history of abnormal thyroid hormone status, a highly pevalent occurrence in humans not only in adult life, but also during fetal development due to maternal thyroid disease. Our research will uncover new mechanisms underlying the heritability of these endocrine conditions. Our results will support comparable translational studies in humans that will ultimately provide novel epigenetic tools and markers for the close monitoring, effective prevention and advisable treatment of endocrine pathologies.",

Maine is the most rural state in the United States and two-\nthirds of hospitals have low birth rates of less than one newborn per day. This low birth rate precludes clinical\nteams from having regular opportunities to maintain essential neonatal resuscitation skills. Strategies to\nimprove and maintain neonatal resuscitation skills at rural hospitals are urgently needed and essential to\npreserve maternal and infant care at critical access hospitals. In situ simulation training has been shown to be\nan effective training tool, allowing delivery room teams to deliberately practice resuscitation skills on a\nmannequin in their native clinical setting with experts present to provide guidance and lead a team debriefing\nfollowing the training session. This training allows rural clinicians to practice essential resuscitation skills\nincluding adherence to the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines, teamwork and communication\nthrough scenarios created to intentionally replicate critical clinical situations. Clinicians then receive directed\nfeedback in debriefing sessions following the simulation training to review their performance and assess for\nareas of improvement.\nThough effective, in situ simulation training in rural hospitals is dependent upon the availability of experts and\nis cost prohibitive due to the expensive simulation equipment. Telesimulation is an alternative method of\nproviding simulation training and employs many of the principles of in situ simulation training, with remote\nparticipation from experts for observation and debrief support. In a pilot study, we demonstrated that regular\nmonthly telesimulation training for 12 months at one rural hospital led to substantial improvements in\nadherence to NRP, teamwork and communication scores. In the proposed randomized non-inferiority cluster\ntrial, we will compare two types of telesimulation technology and employ implementation science to ensure\nconsistency in the approach across different institutions as well as develop a framework to enable\nimplementation at other sites. Specifically, we will test an innovative mixed reality hologram (HoloBabyTM) that\nour research group has developed and patented against the current high-fidelity standard mannequin\ntelesimulation used in our pilot study. The primary outcome is the performance of the medical teams during a\nresuscitation as measured by a score evaluating adherence to the gold standard NRP guideline.\nCommunication and teamwork will also be assessed as secondary outcomes and using The Mayo High\nPerformance Teamwork Scale. The HoloBabyTM leverages novel technology to provide a less expensive\nalternative to make simulation training more widely accessible to rural community hospitals allowing rural\nclinicians to deliberately practice resuscitation skills, prioritizing learning and competence, without\ncompromising patient safety.",

The nervous system is a primary target of opioids through\nactivation of opioid receptors, and the innervation of bone, specifically by sensory neurons, is integral for bone\nhomeostasis. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and can be\nsecreted to affect various cell types, including bone cells. We have developed a model of opioid-induced bone\nloss through systemic morphine treatment, which significantly reduced trabecular bone microarchitecture, bone\nformation, and circulating miRNAs in male mice. Furthermore, several of the circulating miRNAs we identified\nwere also significantly decreased in the bone of morphine-treated mice and have known associations with\nbone outcomes and/or opioid use. miRNA, miR-484 may be integral to reduced osteoblast mineralization\nbased on high expression in healthy mouse and human bone, and it targets genes relevant to osteoblasts. This\nproposal will test the hypothesis that morphine suppresses neuronal miRNA expression, which impairs\nsensory-osteoblast communication through changes in gene expression and contributes to overall bone loss.\nIn Aim 1, we will explore the mechanism of miRNA suppression by morphine through decreased biogenesis\nand/or secretion within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which house the cell bodies of sensory neurons.\nSpecifically, we will treat mice with morphine for 2 or 4 weeks and determine how miRNA expression,\nbiogenesis, and secretion are associated with progressive bone loss. Conditioned media treatment of primary\nosteoblasts from morphine-treated DRG will determine whether morphine indirectly impairs osteoblast\nmineralization. In Aim 2, we will identify the specific role of miR-484 in osteoblast function through in situ\nanalysis of miR-484 in femora of morphine-treated mice as well as overexpression or knockdown of miR-484 in\nprimary osteoblasts. miR-484 gene targets will be assessed at the gene and protein level in addition to\nidentification of novel genes and pathways impacted by miR-484 through RNA sequencing. I will be trained and\nmentored by experts in the field at MHIR and external consultants, which will support my transition to a\npostdoctoral fellow focused on skeletal health. Findings will expand our understanding of opioid-induced bone\nloss through neural-skeletal miRNA communication. Further preclinical studies may then develop strategies to\nmitigate opioid-induced bone loss and inform clinical decisions in the face of the ongoing opioid epidemic.",

                                    "project_description": "Bariatric surgery-associated skeletal complications have been observed since the early 1990s, and are\nassociated with increased fracture risk. The most prevalent bariatric surgery is vertical sleeve gastrectomy\n(VSG), which removes most of the stomach. By 12 months after surgery, bone loss of 4\u20138% in the hip and 3\u2013\n10% in the femoral neck increases fracture risk 1.3 to 2.3-fold. Current clinical management includes bone\nmineral density assessments, consumption of adequate dietary calcium, vitamin D, and protein, and weight-\nbearing exercise. These countermeasures minimize, but do not fully prevent bone loss secondary to bariatric\nsurgery. A clearer mechanistic understanding of bone loss associated with bariatric surgery is necessary to\nproperly design preventive strategies. Changes in gut hormones and microbiota have been proposed to drive\nbone loss, but the effects of loss of the stomach have been largely neglected. We propose that gastric\nsecretory factors contribute to bariatric surgery-induced skeletal complications. In key preliminary data, we\nfound a loss of gastric X/A-like cells (P/D1 cell in humans) and a decrease in secreted ghrelin following VSG.\nGenetic ablation of X/A-like cells was found to improve glucose metabolism and impair trabecular bone mass,\nwhich mimics the metabolic and skeletal consequences of VSG. However, ghrelin supplementation alone does\nnot prevent VSG-induced bone loss. Our proteomic profiling identified ghrelin and somatostatin as the top two\nsecretory proteins enriched in X/A-like cells and decreased by VSG. Moreover, circulating exosome\nconcentrations and gastric RAB27A, a Rab GTPase critical for extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion, were\nsignificantly upregulated by VSG. These data suggest that X/A-like cells are a source of secretory factors vital\nto bone homeostasis, and bariatric surgery disrupts this balance. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to\ndefine the skeletal and metabolic consequences of gastric X/A-like cell ablation and identify X/A-like cell-\nderived secretory factors that affect skeletal homeostasis; and 2) to determine the effects of gastric X/A-like\ncell-derived hormonal factors and EV cargoes on VSG-induced bone loss. In aim 1, we will utilize the X/A-like\ncell ablation mouse model to determine the importance of these cells in skeletal health under conditions of\nmetabolic stress, including diet-induced obesity and estrogen deficiency. Furthermore, we will identify\nsecretory factors from X/A-like cells and determine their roles in osteoblast, osteoclast and adipocyte\ndifferentiation and function. In aim 2, we will test whether somatostatin can enhance the pro-osteogenic effects\nof ghrelin and protect against VSG-induced bone complications. In addition, we will delete Rab27a in X/A-like\ncells to determine its pathophysiological functions in bone, glucose and lipid metabolism under lean healthy,\nobese and VSG conditions. Understanding the significance of X/A-like cells in bone metabolism holds promise\nfor developing new therapeutic targets to manage bariatric surgery-induced bone loss, which remains one of\nthe few time-tested options for improving health of severely obese individuals.",

Maine and Vermont have the oldest populations in the U.S. and that, coupled with rurality, predisposes residents to a range of disorders ranging from cancer to substance use disorders, food insecurity, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We are addressing these health challenges by linking primary care practice centers with academic centers and developing innovative approaches to community-based research. During our first four years, the NNE-CTR has built a strong foundation for clinical research. We partnered with the oldest regional practice-based research network (PBRN), the Dartmouth Co-Op, and actively supported successful NIH program applications, including two COBREs, two NCI program grants, an infrastructure grant for a new Center for Biomedical Shared Resources, and a HRSA grant to build on the opioid treatment model pioneered in Vermont. The NNE-CTR PI is playing a leadership role in coordinating a national CTR network, including the CTR National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a registry to share clinical data on Covid-19 nationally, and the NIH-sponsored RECOVER trial, which will define the long-term sequelae of Covid-19. In this renewal, we plan to expand our collaborations both regionally and nationally and strengthen our PBRN. We will strengthen Core resources that include: the Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design Core, which will improve data capability and research navigation services; the Professional Development Core, which will offer an array of new educational and mentorship opportunities; the Pilot Projects Program, which will provide new and flexible funding mechanisms to offer more support for community-based projects; the Translational Research and Technology Core, offering state-of-the-art technologies and training for new investigators, and the Community Engagement and Outreach Core, which will build stronger bridges to communities. We propose three specific aims: 1-Expand infrastructure and resources to address clinical and translational research needs in northern New England; 2- Strengthen clinical and translational research that expands clinical trial access, telehealth, and mentored training programs for new investigators; and 3-Accelerate regional and national collaborative initiatives within the IDeA networks and through NIH such as N3C and RECOVER.",

Maine and Vermont have the oldest populations in the U.S. and that, coupled with rurality, predisposes residents to a range of disorders ranging from cancer to substance use disorders, food insecurity, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We are addressing these health challenges by linking primary care practice centers with academic centers and developing innovative approaches to community-based research. During our first four years, the NNE-CTR has built a strong foundation for clinical research. We partnered with the oldest regional practice-based research network (PBRN), the Dartmouth Co-Op, and actively supported successful NIH program applications, including two COBREs, two NCI program grants, an infrastructure grant for a new Center for Biomedical Shared Resources, and a HRSA grant to build on the opioid treatment model pioneered in Vermont. The NNE-CTR PI is playing a leadership role in coordinating a national CTR network, including the CTR National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a registry to share clinical data on Covid-19 nationally, and the NIH-sponsored RECOVER trial, which will define the long-term sequelae of Covid-19. In this renewal, we plan to expand our collaborations both regionally and nationally and strengthen our PBRN. We will strengthen Core resources that include: the Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design Core, which will improve data capability and research navigation services; the Professional Development Core, which will offer an array of new educational and mentorship opportunities; the Pilot Projects Program, which will provide new and flexible funding mechanisms to offer more support for community-based projects; the Translational Research and Technology Core, offering state-of-the-art technologies and training for new investigators, and the Community Engagement and Outreach Core, which will build stronger bridges to communities. We propose three specific aims: 1-Expand infrastructure and resources to address clinical and translational research needs in northern New England; 2- Strengthen clinical and translational research that expands clinical trial access, telehealth, and mentored training programs for new investigators; and 3-Accelerate regional and national collaborative initiatives within the IDeA networks and through NIH such as N3C and RECOVER.",

                                    "project_description": "The dramatic underrepresentation of Non-English speakers (NES) in clinical trials contributes to health\ninequities and compromises the generalizability of research. Barriers to enrollment include factors associated\nwith patients (mistrust, competing demands, and challenges with follow-up), researchers (extra time and cost\nrequired for translation, enrollment, communication, and regulatory burdens), and system-related factors\n(inconsistent IRB interpretations of federal regulations, and interpreter availability and willingness to document\nconsent). Our recent research regarding local barriers is consistent with prior publications; the system-related\nfactors identified included staff familiarity with federal regulations, availability of interpreters, willingness of\ninterpreters to sign as witnesses, time for consent discussions, and translating short- and long-form consent\ndocuments. Although an increasing number of publications have reported these barriers, few have proposed\nsolutions. Thus, identifying and testing solutions is a key focus area for research. This study uses a modified\nDelphi method to reach consensus on best practice to overcome system and regulatory barriers. Stakeholders\ninvolved in the Delphi process include Institutional Review Board (IRB) members, research compliance staff,\nprincipal investigators, research coordinators, interpreters and community representatives from a local\norganization serving immigrants and refugees. We will test the resulting process in the Hannaford Center for\nSafety, Innovation & Simulation at MaineHealth for two different types of clinical trials: a trial with first-person\npatient consent and a trial requiring consent from a legally authorized representative given the patient\u2019s\nincapacity at the time of initial enrollment. Simulated consent encounters will include principal investigators,\nresearch staff, interpreters and standardized patients. Simulation participants, community members, IRB\nmembers and compliance staff will evaluate the process through review of recorded simulations and debrief\nmeetings. The consent process will be varied in subsequent simulations in response to stakeholder\nevaluations. A central premise of this study is that it is possible both to achieve the aim of protecting human\nresearch subjects and the health equity aim of including NES in clinical trials. Thus, we seek to study the\ndevelopment of a culturally appropriate and ethically exemplary informed consent process that is no less\nefficient for IRB staff, researchers, and patients than is the pathway for English speaking patients.",

Adding to the dilemma, deaths involving prescription opiate\nanalgesics have almost quadrupled in the last ten years. The clinical challenge of pain\nmanagement is underscored by evidence that chronic pain is mechanistically distinct from acute\npain, therefore a thorough understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying\nthe transition to chronic pain is fundamental to improving and expanding treatment options.\nHyperalgesic priming is a compelling model of the transition to chronic pain in which an initial\ninjury resolves, but leaves the animal in a primed state in which a second insult induces a\ngreatly prolonged pain response. Experiments proposed here will examine the impact of\nmitochondrial dynamics on the development of acute and chronic inflammatory pain compared\nto a nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, and will explore molecular mechanisms mediating\nproposed anti-nociceptive actions of endogenous uncoupling mechanisms and mitochondrial\nuncoupling drugs. Specific Aim 1 will examine the how mitochondrial function changes in\nresponse to noxious insult and the impact of mitochondrial regulation on acute hyperalgesia in\nsensory ganglia. Specific Aim 2 will use patch clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate changes\nin electrical properties of sensory neurons in response to manipulation of mitochondrial function,\nand will identify cell signaling pathways that mediate mitochondrial effects on neuronal\nexcitability. Specific Aim 3 will characterize changes in mitochondrial function unique to the\ntransition to chronic pain, and will elucidate cell signaling pathways modulating the impact of\nmitochondrial function on inflammatory and neuropathic pain chronification. This proposal will\nuse innovative approaches to explore novel mechanisms by which mitochondria influence the\nmanifestation of acute and chronic pain, and test the therapeutic potential of targeting these\nmechanisms for pain relief.",

Patient relief is\nundermined by modest efficacy and/or serious, self-limiting side effects of all current pain pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the\nopioid epidemic, that has only increased in severity as a consequence of COVID-19, lends urgency to the search for\nalternative treatments for moderate to severe pain. Through Phase 1 and 2 COBRE funding and leveraged institutional\nsupport, the University of New England (UNE) Center for the Study of Pain and Sensory Function was successful in\nrenovating new laboratory space, establishing two research core facilities, and recruiting a critical mass of investigators\nstudying pain and its treatment. Provided with mentorship and career development support, research project funding, and\naccess to state-of-the-art research core facilities, COBRE investigators have made major scientific advances in the\ndiscovery of novel targets for the treatment of chronic pain and secured almost $14 million in extramural research\nfunding. The research cores have already supported SBIR and STTR projects that have led to the submission of one\ncompound to the FDA for approval of Phase 1 clinical trials. This increase in research activity seeded by COBRE funds\nwas largely responsible for UNE\u2019s recent promotion to R2 status (denoted as high research activity) by the Carnegie\nClassification of Institutions of Higher Education. COBRE Phase 3 will build on its previous successes to secure the\nCenter\u2019s long-term viability. Strong institutional support will continue to be provided in the form of dedicated core space,\nequipment maintenance, internal funding for a research core voucher program, release time for core Directors and\nguarantee of core staff salary beyond Phase 3. For Aim 1, the COBRE team will continue to increase research capacity\nthrough career development programming and direct financial support for pilot research projects. The Pilot Project\nProgram will accept applications from faculty at UNE and regional partner institutions to support projects that utilize the\ncore facilities and have the potential to lead to extramural funding. This approach will increase the research core user base\nand assist in Aim 2, transitioning the research cores into sustainable resources that provide expertise, training, and state-\nof-the-art instrumentation to the UNE and broader scientific communities for conducting cutting-edge biomedical\nresearch. The research cores will become sustainable through collaborations with regional COBREs and Maine INBRE\npartners, the combined efforts of the External Advisory and Steering Committees, strong institutional support, and an\naggressive business strategic planning and marketing approach. COBRE Phases 1 and 2 profoundly transformed the\nresearch environment at UNE. At the time of Phase 1 submission, core research facilities were nonexistent. The increase\nin research capacity created through the COBRE program has led to the recruitment and funding of a critical mass of\ninvestigators, training of a skilled workforce, and development of sustainable core research facilities that can support\nhigh-quality research for UNE faculty and students, as well as external academic and industry partners. With continued\ninstitutional investment and additional support provided through Phase 3 funding, we will build on this early success and\nestablish our center as a leader in pain research for many years to come.",

While physiological corneal pain (nociceptive pain) protects the eye from injury,\ninflammation and/or nerve damage can result in prolonged or chronic corneal pain. Corneal afferents represent\na diverse population of neurons, with specialized properties related to maintaining ocular health. The full\ndiversity of these neurons, and their responses to injury are unknown. The first set of experiments will\ndetermine the mRNA transcript signatures of mouse corneal neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and their\ntranscriptional responses to corneal injury and compare with cell-type-specific transcriptional and epigenomic\nsignatures of human TG neurons. Corneal afferents are known to project to two main regions in the spinal\ntrigeminal nucleus (Vsp), each with distinct roles in nociception and maintaining corneal homeostasis. We have\npreliminary data demonstrating an additional projection to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a region\ncritical in regulating complex motivational-affective responses to aversive stimuli. Its contribution to corneal\npain is unknown. The second set of experiments will examine central processing of corneal input in the lPBN.\nWe will determine the contribution of corneal->lPBN primary afferent projections to corneal nociceptive\nresponses and the function of lPBN neurons in corneal nociceptive and chronic pain behaviors. Additional\nstudies will perform single-nucleus transcriptome analysis to identify molecular profiles of corneal-activated\nbrainstem neurons, followed by multiplex in situ hybridization to provide spatial resolution in regions that\nreceive direct corneal afferent input. The cornea is also endowed with resident corneal leukocytes (RCLs)\nresiding in close proximity to corneal nerves, suggesting the possibility of neuro-immune crosstalk in the\ncornea. However, current knowledge is limited on possible direct regulation of RCLs through corneal nerves, or\nthe influence of RCLs on corneal nerve function. The third set of experiments will characterize the cell\npopulations and molecular mechanisms involved in neuroimmune crosstalk resulting in peripheral nerve\nsensitization in the cornea. Corneal single cell mRNA transcript signatures associated in murine corneal pain\nmodels will be used to identify transcriptional changes that underly nociceptor sensitization. Crossing these\nimmune cell transcripts with transcript profiles of corneal afferents will provide evidence for ligand-receptor\npairs. In vitro studies will confirm the ability of the identified modulators to sensitize TG neurons, and the\nfunctional significance will be assessed using behavior and ex vivo electrophysiology. Employing a\nmultidisciplinary approach, these experiments will provide a comprehensive analysis of cellular and molecular\nmechanisms of nociceptive and chronic corneal pain, leading to the identification novel pathways and\ntreatments.",

Mechanisms contributing to epileptogenesis are difficult to\nidentify in humans due to genetic and environmental diversity, and as such, preclinical models provide advantages for\nelucidating epileptogenic processes. Our Fos activation pathway and lesion analyses suggest that the ventromedial nucleus\nof the hypothalamus (VMH) is a critical anatomical node for the propagation of seizure discharge from the forebrain\nseizure network to the brainstem seizure network. Our preliminary data further support this hypothesis as loss of\nglutamate transport into presynaptic vesicles by deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter gene, Vglut2, solely in the\nVMH can block seizure propagation into the brainstem seizure network, which contains cardio-respiratory centers. Access\nof seizure discharge into the brainstem results in both brainstem-tonic seizures and increases the probability of Sudden\nUnexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). These data suggest the hypothesis that the VMH is a critical anatomical node\nfor seizure-induced plasticity. It also indicates a VMH neuroanatomical pathway, which may be important in SUDEP,\nsince preventing seizure discharge from propagating into brainstem cardio-respiratory centers could prevent SUDEP. Our\nlong-term goal is to identify neuroanatomical substrates and signaling pathways critical for epileptogenesis, so that\ntherapeutic treatments and preventative strategies can be developed for epilepsy and SUDEP in humans. The overall\nobjectives of this proposal build upon our previous work and preliminary data leading to the following aims/objectives: 1)\nElucidate the mechanisms by which the VMH is involved in the epileptogenic process for allowing ictal discharge\npropagation from the forebrain seizure network into the brainstem seizure network and 2) Determine the genomic\nlandscape in the VMH using spatial transcriptomics before and during epileptogenesis. In Aim 1, we will assess VMH\nreorganizational process using 1) mice with VMH-targeted deletion of genes (i.e., Vglut2, trkB, Bdnf) in our repeated\nflurothyl model to assess seizure outcomes and 2) assess changes in afferent and efferent connectivity to the VMH via\nTimm\u2019s staining (fiber sprouting) and tract tracing. For Aim 2, we will utilize the novel approach of spatial\ntranscriptomics to perform cell-type and regional whole transcriptome analysis using a NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial\nProfiler and Illumina sequencing to determine gene expression changes in different populations of VMH neurons.\nExpression differences will be confirmed by qRT-PCR and/or immunolabeling. Overall, our proposal will elucidate\nseizure response mechanisms that initiate and contribute to epileptogenesis and provide a framework of transcriptional\nnetworks contributing to epileptogenesis that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention for epilepsy and/or SUDEP.",

                                    "project_description": "Irisin is a novel signaling peptide proteolyzed from the cell membrane-bound protein Fndc5 (fibronectin type III\ndomain-containing protein 5), first described by our collaborators to release from muscle during exercise and\ninduce a thermogenic program in beige adipose tissue. A growing body of work has highlighted another key\nrole for irisin in mediating the effect of exercise on bone. Early work described an anabolic action, with\nintermittent low doses of irisin stimulating cortical bone formation and preventing unloading-induced bone loss\nin vivo, and serum-derived irisin from exercised mice enhancing osteoblastogenesis in vitro. Our group has\nemployed a genetic approach to further elucidate the role of irisin in skeletal remodeling, demonstrating that\nforced expression of Fndc5 in muscle markedly reduced bone formation and osteoblast numbers while\nincreasing sclerostin (SOST) expression and osteoclast numbers. Global genetic deletion of Fndc5 conferred\ncomplete protection against ovariectomy-induced bone loss, marked by maintenance of osteocyte lacunae and\nblocked bone resorption with no increases in Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-\u03b2 Ligand (RANKL)\nexpression despite prolonged estrogen deprivation. Similarly, short term irisin infusions in wild type mice\nresulted in higher serum levels of sclerostin and RANKL. These results highlight the breadth of irisin\u2019s signaling\neffects in bone, and the need to further understand its overall impact on resorption and remodelling. We now\nhave additional evidence that irisin signals directly to the osteoclast via integrin \u03b1V\u03b25, stimulating differentiation\nand resorption. The present work endeavors to delineate the full signaling pathway in the osteoclast, while\nemploying novel in vivo models to test this regulation of resorption in the context of skeletal response to\nexercise. We have developed a novel conditional mouse allele of Fndc5 and generated a skeletal muscle-\nspecific targeted null, which we will use to test the effect of muscle-derived irisin on bone response to exercise.\nIn parallel, we will utilize in vitro techniques to confirm the putative receptors for irisin and characterize\nintracellular signal transduction in the osteoclast. To comprehensively assess irisin\u2019s impact on bone\nresorption, we will also investigate indirect effects of irisin on the osteoclast, through regulation by the\nosteocyte. Finally, as osteocyte response to mechanical cues is a key aspect of this cell\u2019s function during\nexercise, we will investigate the potential interplay between irisin signaling and mechanosensitivity. We predict\npleiotropic effects of irisin \u2013 it may be a coupling factor by directly stimulating both the osteoblast and\nosteoclast, and also serve a unique role as a counter regulatory hormone to maintain calcium homeostasis by\nincreasing resorption. By focusing on the osteoclast, this work seeks to elucidate irisin\u2019s role in initiating bone\nresorption and better understand its influence on remodeling as a whole. Such insights both provide a greater\nunderstanding of skeletal response to exercise but inform efforts to address bone degenerative diseases by\ntaking advantage of native signaling pathways.",

We have\npreliminary data demonstrating an additional projection to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a region\ncritical in regulating complex motivational-affective responses to aversive stimuli. Its contribution to corneal\npain is unknown. The second set of experiments will examine central processing of corneal input in the lPBN.\nWe will determine the contribution of corneal->lPBN primary afferent projections to corneal nociceptive\nresponses and the function of lPBN neurons in corneal nociceptive and chronic pain behaviors. Additional\nstudies will perform single-nucleus transcriptome analysis to identify molecular profiles of corneal-activated\nbrainstem neurons, followed by multiplex in situ hybridization to provide spatial resolution in regions that\nreceive direct corneal afferent input. The cornea is also endowed with resident corneal leukocytes (RCLs)\nresiding in close proximity to corneal nerves, suggesting the possibility of neuro-immune crosstalk in the\ncornea. However, current knowledge is limited on possible direct regulation of RCLs through corneal nerves, or\nthe influence of RCLs on corneal nerve function. The third set of experiments will characterize the cell\npopulations and molecular mechanisms involved in neuroimmune crosstalk resulting in peripheral nerve\nsensitization in the cornea. Corneal single cell mRNA transcript signatures associated in murine corneal pain\nmodels will be used to identify transcriptional changes that underly nociceptor sensitization. Crossing these\nimmune cell transcripts with transcript profiles of corneal afferents will provide evidence for ligand-receptor\npairs. In vitro studies will confirm the ability of the identified modulators to sensitize TG neurons, and the\nfunctional significance will be assessed using behavior and ex vivo electrophysiology. Employing a\nmultidisciplinary approach, these experiments will provide a comprehensive analysis of cellular and molecular\nmechanisms of nociceptive and chronic corneal pain, leading to the identification novel pathways and\ntreatments.",

HIV-SN frequently manifests with hard-to-manage pain and is often\nunder-diagnosed and/or under-treated, yet, the large variation in prevalence does not allow for detection of\nsignificant differences in prevalence between HAART-exposed vs. HAART-non-exposed individuals. There is\nno specific FDA-approved treatment for HIV-SN. Tat, trans-activator of transcription, a regulatory protein\namong the first proteins expressed following HIV infection, is a key activator of HIV transcription and can affect\nboth HIV infected cells and non-infected neighboring cells via its secretion by infected cells. Although human\nstudies are lacking, recent animal studies using two models of doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic\n(iTat) mice from our lab and others provided convincing evidence that HIV Tat contributes to the development\nof HIV-SN. Therefore, in this proposal, we will further investigate the underlying mechanisms of Tat-associated\nSN. Our preliminary study identified potential regulation of Tat of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway.\nGiven the widely accepted involvement of TLR pathway in neuropathic pain and surprising lack of studies\nexploring the role of TLR pathway in HIV-SN, we will focus on TLR pathway in Tat-associated SN in this study.\nWe will take advantage of bioinformatic tools to identify FDA-approved drugs without significant interactions\nwith existing antiretroviral drugs that could potentially reverse Tat-induced changes in TLR pathway, and then\ntest their effectiveness in treating Tat-associated SN in vivo. Altogether, we hypothesize that TLR signaling\npathway is involved in the development of HIV-Tat-associated SN and it is possible to identify potential\ntreatment for HIV-SN by examining existing drugs via a combined bioinformatics and pre-clinical model\napproach. This will be tested through 2 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the contribution of Tollip (a key\nregulator of TLR pathway)-regulated TLR pathways in HIV Tat-associated SN using genetically modified\nanimal models in combination with behavioral and physiological tests. Aim 2 will identify potential drugs for\nHIV-SN by targeting TLR pathway via a combined bioinformatics and pre-clinical model approach. If\nsuccessful, we will fill in the knowledge gaps regarding Tat-associated SN and TLRs\u2019 role in HIV-SN. Our\ncomprehensive combination drug discovery strategy will help identify potential drugs for HIV-SN, which can be\nfurther tested in other animal models before clinical assessment. Throughout the process, we will prioritize\ndrug candidates that are mechanistically-sound, and potentially easily accessible to all patients.",

Recent advances demonstrate this\nplasticity is initiated and maintained by de novo translation of pro-nociceptive genes. In animal models,\npharmacological and genetic perturbations of protein translation have shown therapeutic efficacy. Therefore,\ndiscovery of proteins that selectively regulate pro-nociceptive mRNA translation in sensory neurons would\nprovide opportunities for the development of novel targeted therapeutics. mRNA translation is regulated by\nRNA-Binding proteins (RBPs). Our analyses of single cell RNA-Seq data confirmed by histological\nassessments revealed the presence of a RBP restricted to subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion (DRG)\nnociceptive neurons. Previous studies indicate that this RBP binds to and inhibits translation of mRNA\ntranscripts associated with neuronal excitability. Our computational analyses predicted that this nociceptor-\nrestricted RBP would suppress a constellation of ion channels, neuropeptides and other \u201cpain genes\u201d, thereby\nforming a putative anti-nociceptive regulon. This proposal will test the hypothesis that this identified RBP\ntonically suppresses nociceptive transmission by binding to and inhibiting translation of pro-nociceptive\nmRNAs. This proposal will determine if enhancing the function of this RBP is a viable strategy to develop\ninterventions that normalize pain thresholds and reverse chronic pain. In doing so these investigations will\ndemonstrate a novel anti-nociceptive regulon that scales the threshold for pain perception and validate use of a\ntool to discover factors responsible for the transition",

                                    "project_description": "Project Summary/Abstract\nChemotherapeutic agents are often dose limiting due to the emergence of a debilitating and painful\nneuropathy, posing a major challenge to the successful treatment of cancer. Recent reports demonstrate that\nmale mice lacking T cells have prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity after treatment with paclitaxel (PTX),\nand only the intravenous transfer of CD8+, but not CD4+, T cells reduced the hypersensitivity. Our preliminary\nin vivo data demonstrates female mice have 2-fold more CD4+ T cells in the DRG than male and\novariectomized (OVX) female mice, and neuronal injury induced by PTX robustly increases anti-inflammatory\nCD4+ T cells in the DRG only in estrogen-competent female mice. CD4+ T cell depletion in female mice prior to\nPTX results in an increase in mechanical hypersensitivity 3 days post-PTX. Our results suggest a previously\nunexplored hormone and sex difference in CD4+ T cells and the severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral\nneuropathy (CIPN). PTX is primarily used to treat ovarian, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer with post-\nmenopausal patients at an increased risk of CIPN; therefore, preventative measures would be invaluable for\nwomen. The mechanism by which CD4+ T cells reduce the severity of PIPN is unknown. In our preliminary\nstudies, DRG neurons from female mice have the capacity to activate CD4+ T cells to secrete anti-\ninflammatory cytokines. Published RNA-seq datasets of DRG neurons show that DRG neurons express\nMHCII, a protein directly involved in T cell activation. Our central hypothesis is that PTX administration in\nfemale mice increases MHCII on sensory neurons to stimulate the paracrine release of anti-inflammatory\ncytokines by resident CD4+ T cells to suppress CIPN. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which estrogen-\ndriven CD4+ T cells reduce the severity of PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy. Estrogen is known to induce\nproliferation of blood CD4+ T cells, but it is unknown if this occurs in the DRG. We predict that estrogen\nsignaling in CD4+ T cells will increase the number of resident CD4+ T cells in the DRG to secrete anti-\ninflammatory cytokines in response to PTX. We expect CD4+ T cells to ameliorate CIPN in female, but not\nmale mice. In Aim 2, we will quantify the extent PTX can enhance MHCII on DRG neurons to induce anti-\ninflammatory CD4+ T cell cytokine production. We predict PTX-induced inflammation will increase neuronal\nMHCII to elicit an anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response in the DRG of female, but not male mice. In Aim 3,\nwe will determine the degree in vivo activation of neuroprotective CD4+ T cells can reduce and reverse PTX-\ninduced peripheral neuropathy. We predict that activated CD4+ T cells will dampen and reverse CIPN in\nfemale, but not male mice, unless pre-treated with estrogen. Completion of these aims will provide compelling\nevidence that CD4+ T cells in the DRG of females are neuroprotective and anti-nociceptive, and can be\nexploited to prevent or resolve CIPN. Neuronal MHCII-dependent activation of CD4+ T cells represents a novel\nmechanism for neuro-immune communication that could be utilized for therapeutic intervention.",

However,\nthe mechanisms underlying these sex differences are largely unknown, a key gap in the literature. Our long-\nterm goal is to understand the neurological substrates that underlie the different effects of neonatal pain and\nstress on vulnerability to negative affect disorders, including chronic pain, during the juvenile period in male\nand female rats. To accomplish this, we will expose neonatal rats to NICU-like treatment including a series of\nrepetitive paw pricks which results in a latent vulnerability. Our central hypothesis is that the underlying\nneuro/endocrine mechanisms differ between the sexes. For example, we have previously demonstrated that\nexposure to a subsequent \u201cactivating\u201d stressor during the juvenile period unmasks alterations to negative\naffective behavior and pain thresholds in both sexes following neonatal pain. However, the neurobiology\nunderlying these changes differ. For example, Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF)-containing cells within the\ncentral nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are particularly responsive during neonatal trauma and are reduced in\nnumber later in life, but only in male rats. Females, although also affected by neonatal pain, do not appear to\nundergo the same changes in the amygdalar CRF system. Importantly, however, intra-amygdala CRF1\nantagonists can reverse the hypersensitivity in both sexes. Thus, while CRF-expressing cells in the CeA are\nonly involved in male rats, CRF receptors are involved in both sexes, suggesting involvement of a non-\namygdala source of CRF in females. Preliminary data point to the hypothalamus. To better understand these\ndifferences, we propose a series of innovative experiments to identify the behavioral and brain changes\nunderlying the different effects of neonatal pain in male and female rats. Specific Aim 1 proposes hi-plex in\nsitu hybridization and florescent immunohistochemistry designed to assess changes in neuropeptide gene\nexpression and cellular phenotypes in the amygdala and hypothalamus to examine differences between male\nand female rats exposed to NICU-like experiences. While the function of some individual genes and\nbiomarkers have been established, many cells co-express several neuropeptides and the various overlapping\nexpression patterns of these neuropeptides has not been studied. Specific Aim 2 looks for changes in\nneuronal activation patterns in identified cell types in the amygdala and hypothalamus and correlates this with\nchanges in behavior, using immediate early gene signaling as a proxy for neuronal activation. Together, these\nexperiments will fill in critical gaps in our knowledge regarding sex differences in the lasting consequences of\nneonatal pain.",

This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text.\nThe goal of this Transdisciplinary Predoctoral Training Program is to provide future scientists and engineers with a uniquely integrative education to facilitate their development as innovative transdisciplinary scientists. The Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering (GSBSE) at the University of Maine is an ideal home for this transdisciplinary T32. GSBSE is a statewide biomedical science and engineering PhD program that encompasses not only UMaine, but also the Jackson Laboratory, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, MaineHealth Institute for Research, and the University of New England. Thus, the GSBSE leverages the expertise and infrastructure of the state\u2019s premier biomedical research programs. GSBSE significantly contributes to Maine\u2019s burgeoning focus on bioscience by nucleating new collaborations within and between GSBSE institutions. With 150 faculty and 90 students, the GSBSE\u2019s research mission is broad and spans the areas of computational biology, cell and molecular biology, and general medical sciences. The GSBSE emphasizes transdisciplinary collaboration and skills required for team science to prepare students for future biomedical research. The 2019-2024 T32 Transdisciplinary Predoctoral Training Program in Biomedical Science and Engineering, UMaine\u2019s first T32, has been very successful. It supported 17 trainees for their first and second years, with 5 subsequently receiving F31 grants. This renewal includes 64 funded faculty members who are committed to transdisciplinary research, full support of partner institutes who provide resources and commitment to predoctoral trainees, a strong foundational curriculum in the biomedical sciences integrated with engineering principles, and advisory committees to oversee and evaluate program outcomes. This program will be administered at the University of Maine and incorporates a multiple PI model. Drs. Gregory Cox (Director, GSBSE), Clarissa Henry (Professor, University of Maine) and Lucy Liaw (Faculty Scientist, MaineHealth Institute for Research) all have significant mentorship, administrative, and leadership experience. This T32 proposes to provide support for 8 predoctoral students in their second and third years of study, all of whom will receive the enhanced training strategies described in this proposal.",

                                    "project_description": "Musculoskeletal function requires integration of skeletal muscle with two different junctions: neuromuscular\njunctions (NMJs) and myotendinous junctions (MTJs). Action potentials are transmitted through NMJs to\nsignal muscle contraction. Muscle contraction then transmits force through MTJs to move the skeleton.\nDisruption of either of these junctions can lead to incurable neuromuscular degenerative\ndiseases that shorten lifespan and deleteriously impact quality of life. Despite their importance, the\nmechanisms underlying coordinated development and homeostasis of NMJs, muscle, and MTJs are not\nentirely understood. NMJs and MTJs connect to muscle through cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion\ncomplexes such as the Dystrophin Glycoprotein Complex. Dystroglycan (DG) is a critical transmembrane\nreceptor in the Dystrophin Glycoprotein Complex that requires glycosylation to bind to the ECM. A critical\nbuilding block for DG glycosylation is Dolichylphosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man), which is generated by the\nDol-P-Man synthase complex. Humans with mutations in any of the three components of this complex\n(Dpm1,2,3) can show failure to thrive and they have progressive muscle degeneration, resulting in a life\nexpectancy of 20 years or less. Thus, glycosylation plays critical roles in NMJ and MTJ integrity. We propose to\nuse the zebrafish model to provide insight into the basic cell biology underlying neuromusculoskeletal diseases\nwhere glycosylation is disrupted as a necessary step towards identifying future therapeutic targets. To\nunderstand how loss of Dol-P-Man leads to muscle degeneration, we generated a zebrafish model with\ntruncated Dpm3, the stabilizing subunit in Dol-P-Man synthesis. In dpm3 mutants, NMJ and MTJ\ndevelopment are disrupted, muscle growth is reduced, there is neuromuscular degeneration, and death occurs\nby 3 weeks. We next created dpm3;dg double mutants to determine whether glycosylation of DG by Dpm3 is\nresponsible for this phenotype. The enhanced phenotype of dpm3;dg homozygous double mutants, with severe\nmuscle degeneration and death by just 1 week, suggests that DG-independent actions of Dol-P-Man have been\noverlooked. We will use our unique genetic models to elucidate cell-type specific noncanonical functions for\nDpm3 and Dg to test the overall hypothesis that DPM3 and DG play interrelated and independent roles that\nare critical for cell-matrix adhesion in NMJs, muscle, and MTJs formation and maintenance. We will do this\nby completing the following two aims. Aim 1: Elucidate motor neuron- and muscle-specific roles for Dol-P-Man\nand DG at the NMJ. Aim 2: Determine how Dol-P-Man and DG play unique and synergistic roles to promote\ncell-matrix adhesion during MTJ development and muscle growth. Taken together, experiments in this\nproposal will integrate our unique genetic models to elucidate cell-type specific canonical and noncanonical\nroles for Dpm3 and Dg with powerful imaging approaches to quantitatively understand the coordination\nbetween the NMJ and MTJ during development and homeostasis in normal and diseased states.",

Overall, 12 UMaine\nfaculty, their technicians, undergraduate, and graduate students use the Zebrafish Facility for their research on\nan annual basis. These faculty represent a number of different units at UMaine including the Department of\nMolecular and Biomedical Sciences, the School of Biology and Ecology, and the School of Marine Sciences.\nZebrafish have been used by UMaine faculty studying many different disease processes, including influenza,\nmuscular dystrophy, and Candida fungal infections. The Zebrafish Facility is also relevant to UMaine faculty in\ndisciplines such as electrical and computer engineering, who are developing devices and technologies to\naddress the prevention and treatment of human disease processes.\nUMaine\u2019s current zebrafish facility typically operates at 98-100% capacity. Although an excellent facility that is\n93% base-funded by the University of Maine; the limited capacity hinders all investigators who use the\nzebrafish model. UMaine\u2019s first Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) grant, which started in\nApril 2023, provides the initial nucleus of funding for converting a teaching laboratory into an additional\nzebrafish facility that will more than double the available space for zebrafish. The remainder of the necessary\nfunding for the renovation is being provided by the University of Maine, demonstrating the deep commitment of\nUMaine to this project. The Office of the Vice President for Research at UMaine has also committed funds to\npurchase some necessary equipment including the live feed systems, dosing system, spawning tanks, and\ncrossing shelves (see letter of support). Here, we propose to purchase the central filtration system for the\nfacility, as well as 11 double-sided racks and the AquaTouch 2 monitoring system. These will more than double\nour current capacity for stock maintenance and increase daily breeding capacity from 25 to 175 tanks per day.\nThis increased capacity is necessary for the continued success of this shared zebrafish facility. Thus, receipt of\nthis grant will have a tremendous impact on research growth at the University of Maine.",

Approximately 50% of women have\ndense breasts, which increases their risk 3-5 fold compared to those with entirely fatty breasts, but only a subset\nof them will develop breast cancer. One explanation lies in tumor microenvironment (TME) changes that promote\na breast tumorigenic environment. The organization of stromal and glandular breast tissue subtypes plays a\ncrucial role in influencing tumor invasion dynamics. However, there has been limited research on mammographic\nsubtypes of dense tissue and their potential links to risk. In the original R15 funding period the PI and his team\nshowed that they can segregate mammographic dense tissue into two textural subtypes: active dense tissue,\nwhich is structurally reorganizing and links to cancer dynamics, versus passive dense tissue. More recently, they\nfound that tissue restructuring associated with early tumor onset may be detectable via computational\nmammography prior to radiological diagnosis. The original R15 grant helped show that the amounts and temporal\nchange of mammographic dense tissue subtypes may influence cancer risk. In this renewal, a novel and powerful\ncomputational technique is proposed to complement the textural analysis for mammogram and also for histology\nwhole slide imaging both proximal and distal to the tumor and for several tumor subtypes. The proposed research\nwill advance the education and career preparation of undergraduates within Maine\u2019s only biomedical engineering\nprogram, nurture a growing partnership among the University of Maine, Spectrum Healthcare Partners and\nMaine Medical Research Institute, introduce two UMaine faculty to biomedical research, and support the early\ncareer development of two assistant professors.",

This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text.\nThe goal of this Transdisciplinary Predoctoral Training Program is to provide future scientists and engineers with a uniquely integrative education to facilitate their development as innovative transdisciplinary scientists. The Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering (GSBSE) at the University of Maine is an ideal home for this transdisciplinary T32. GSBSE is a statewide biomedical science and engineering PhD program that encompasses not only UMaine, but also the Jackson Laboratory, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, MaineHealth Institute for Research, and the University of New England. Thus, the GSBSE leverages the expertise and infrastructure of the state\u2019s premier biomedical research programs. GSBSE significantly contributes to Maine\u2019s burgeoning focus on bioscience by nucleating new collaborations within and between GSBSE institutions. With 150 faculty and 90 students, the GSBSE\u2019s research mission is broad and spans the areas of computational biology, cell and molecular biology, and general medical sciences. The GSBSE emphasizes transdisciplinary collaboration and skills required for team science to prepare students for future biomedical research. The 2019-2024 T32 Transdisciplinary Predoctoral Training Program in Biomedical Science and Engineering, UMaine\u2019s first T32, has been very successful. It supported 17 trainees for their first and second years, with 5 subsequently receiving F31 grants. This renewal includes 64 funded faculty members who are committed to transdisciplinary research, full support of partner institutes who provide resources and commitment to predoctoral trainees, a strong foundational curriculum in the biomedical sciences integrated with engineering principles, and advisory committees to oversee and evaluate program outcomes. This program will be administered at the University of Maine and incorporates a multiple PI model. Drs. Gregory Cox (Director, GSBSE), Clarissa Henry (Professor, University of Maine) and Lucy Liaw (Faculty Scientist, MaineHealth Institute for Research) all have significant mentorship, administrative, and leadership experience. This T32 proposes to provide support for 8 predoctoral students in their second and third years of study, all of whom will receive the enhanced training strategies described in this proposal.",

However, there are few options available for their treatment, and\nwithout pathomechanisms being sufficiently elucidated, one's ability to generate a rationale for interventions is\ngreatly limited. Our studies are expected to address this barrier by establishing new etiological factors and\nmolecular mechanisms of mammalian neurodegeneration. One such mechanism is Ribosome-associated\nQuality Control (RQC), that mediates the degradation of incomplete polypeptides produced by ribosomes that\nstall during translation. Key factors working in RQC are the Ltn1/Listerin E3 ubiquitin ligase and its partner,\nNEMF (Rqc2 in yeast). PI Joazeiro has previously found that Ltn1 mutation causes neurodegeneration in mice.\nPI Cox has more recently identified two independent mutations in mouse Nemf causing motor neuron disease\nand used this to knowledge to identify previously undiagnosed patients with a similar neuromuscular condition\nthat inherited causative mutations in the human NEMF gene. In several ways, Ltn1-ENU and Nemf-ENU mice\nphenocopy each other, thus strengthening the connection between RQC dysfunction and neurodegeneration.\nThe proposed studies are aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration\ncaused by NEMF loss of function. We focus our analyses on a recently-discovered activity of NEMF that is\nconserved from bacteria to humans\u2013the modification of aberrant nascent chains with C-terminal Alanine tails\nthat have a proteolytic function. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that NEMF-mediated Ala tailing\nprotects neurons against degeneration.

This two\u2010phase R61/R33 project aims to break down silos characterizing decades\u2010long AT\ndevelopment by developing an integrated mul\u019fsensory naviga\u019fon solu\u019fon, called Mul\u019fNav, which converges pre\u2010journey\nmap learning with in\u2010situ naviga\u019fon assistance, wrapped in a learnable and usable smartphone applica\u019fon with strong\npathways to transla\u019fon. To do so, Mul\u019fNav advances the state of the art for mul\u019fsensory access iden\u019f\ufb01ca\u019fon through\ndevelopment of the \ufb01rst user\u2010centered design guidelines specifying the key informa\u019fon/modality (I/M) pairings needed\nto support the highest probability naviga\u019fon tasks across the complete trip. U\u019flizing these I/M pairings, the Mul\u019fNav app's\nmul\u019fsensory mapping system provides users with route and environmental overviews for use in both pre\u2010journey\nexplora\u019fon and during real\u2010\u019fme travel, enabling BVI people to obtain a level of environmental access, naviga\u019fonal\nassistance, and spa\u019fal learning capabili\u019fes that are simply not possible from current naviga\u019fon AT solu\u019fons. A signi\ufb01cant\ninnova\u019fon of Mul\u019fNav's approach is that route guidance and map overview informa\u019fon are coupled with a unique\nexplora\u019fon modes that enables BVI users to learn the real\u2010world environmental features necessary for safe street crossing\n(e.g., intersec\u019fon geometry, presence of medians, loca\u019fons of accessible pedestrian signals), as well as a tra\ufb03c view mode\nthat provides mul\u019fsensory \u019fme\u2010of\u2010day tra\ufb03c data to enable users to hear and feel how a crossing will be navigated in\nadvance.

This fragmented approach focuses on isolated tasks (pre\u2010journey learning vs. in\u2010situ naviga\u019fon), segregated\ninforma\u019fon (routes vs. maps), speci\ufb01c modali\u019fes (language vs. hap\u019fc), and siloed technology development (digital apps\nvs. physical tac\u019fle maps). This two\u2010phase R61/R33 project aims to break down silos characterizing decades\u2010long AT\ndevelopment by developing an integrated mul\u019fsensory naviga\u019fon solu\u019fon, called Mul\u019fNav, which converges pre\u2010journey\nmap learning with in\u2010situ naviga\u019fon assistance, wrapped in a learnable and usable smartphone applica\u019fon with strong\npathways to transla\u019fon. To do so, Mul\u019fNav advances the state of the art for mul\u019fsensory access iden\u019f\ufb01ca\u019fon through\ndevelopment of the \ufb01rst user\u2010centered design guidelines specifying the key informa\u019fon/modality (I/M) pairings needed\nto support the highest probability naviga\u019fon tasks across the complete trip. U\u019flizing these I/M pairings, the Mul\u019fNav app's\nmul\u019fsensory mapping system provides users with route and environmental overviews for use in both pre\u2010journey\nexplora\u019fon and during real\u2010\u019fme travel, enabling BVI people to obtain a level of environmental access, naviga\u019fonal\nassistance, and spa\u019fal learning capabili\u019fes that are simply not possible from current naviga\u019fon AT solu\u019fons. A signi\ufb01cant\ninnova\u019fon of Mul\u019fNav's approach is that route guidance and map overview informa\u019fon are coupled with a unique\nexplora\u019fon modes that enables BVI users to learn the real\u2010world environmental features necessary for safe street crossing\n(e.g., intersec\u019fon geometry, presence of medians, loca\u019fons of accessible pedestrian signals), as well as a tra\ufb03c view mode\nthat provides mul\u019fsensory \u019fme\u2010of\u2010day tra\ufb03c data to enable users to hear and feel how a crossing will be navigated in\nadvance. These features are introduced to users in a gami\ufb01ed learning mode such that the user interface can be learned,\nunderstood, and u\u019flized long\u2010term via engaging naviga\u019fon scenarios. As a result, Mul\u019fNav's user\u2010driven inclusive design\napproach is expected to solve high\u2010probability naviga\u019fon challenges with tractable and measurable outcomes that will\nsigni\ufb01cantly improve BVI mobility, independence, and overall quality of life as a sustainable pla\u019eorm with widespread\nadop\u019fon.",

Timely access to STEM materials is one of the biggest challenges for BVI learners, limiting their\nproductivity and success. While access to textual information has largely been solved via screen reading software\n(e.g., JAWS or VoiceOver), very little progress has been made in making non-textual (i.e., graphical) information\naccessible for BVI people. With STEM curricula being dominated by non-textual information (e.g., diagrams,\ngraphs, charts, images, mathematical notations), the visual nature of this critical information prevents more than\n660,000 school-aged (ages 4-21) BVI learners from pursuing STEM curricula. Current technologies/devices\naddress the issue via human-driven approaches using specialized single purpose hardware that suffer from\nseveral shortcomings including high cost, limited portability, lack of multi-purpose, and inability to present\ninformation in a real-time context. Importantly, a common underlying problem across all extant approaches is\nthat they require intensive human efforts for producing or authoring tactile (and/or multimodal) graphics. These\napproaches lead to high production costs and significant delays from the time the accessible materials are needed\nto when they are actually delivered; ultimately adversely impacting BVI individuals\u2019 learning and advancement\nin K-12 schools, colleges, and performance in workplace settings. To address this long-standing problem, in\nPhase I, UNAR Labs developed a prototype version of Midlina\u2019s framework using Math worksheets as an\nexample and demonstrated its practical utility by implementing it on a prototype web application, called Kanak.\nIn this Phase II effort, UNAR Labs will build on the success of Phase I by extending the capability of Midlina\u2019s\nframework and establishing it as a commercially viable platform technology for generating/converting STEM\nmaterials into accessible formats. We will also develop and deploy two Midlina-powered applications, (1) Kanak\n\u2013a web application aimed at aiding teachers and TVIs with real-time accessible document creation, and (2)\nMathAlly \u2013 an IOS app that helps BVI learners access accessible math materials in real-time. The team is highly\nexperienced in developing assistive technology solutions. Successful completion of the project will provide a\nrobust system for increasing the participation of BVI individuals in STEM programs and will make educational\ninstitutions more inclusive and equitable.",

Mounting\nevidence suggests CPC is bioavailable, retained in tissue, toxic to eukaryotes at low doses, and present in\nhumans. Mitochondrial dysfunction/deformation lead to neurological, immunological, and other diseases. We\ndiscovered that exposure-relevant, non-cytotoxic CPC doses potently perturb mitochondria (ATP, morphology,\noxygen consumption) and cause Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria, but the mechanisms remain unknown. This\nproject will determine the underlying mechanisms and outcomes of CPC mitochondrial toxicity and, critically,\nwill promulgate new general mechanisms of mitotoxicity. Our preliminary data show CPC impedes multiple\nelectron transport chain (ETC) components. CPC also suppresses immune cell signaling via interference with\nphosphorylation, Ca2+ dynamics, and protein binding to key signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-\nbisphosphate (PIP2). Preliminary data reveal CPC disruption of PIP2 diffusion and cluster properties at the\nplasma membrane. PIP2 is also found at the outer mitochondrial membrane and its disruption leads to\nmitochondrial fission--though understanding of PIP2\u2019s mitochondrial biology is in its infancy. We hypothesize\nthat CPC interferes with PIP2, phosphorylation, Ca2+, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and\nspecific ETC Complexes/associated lipids and enzymes, thus disorganizing mitochondrial shape and function.\nUsing immune (mast and T cells) and barrier (skin, oral, GI) cells, we will assess CPC effects on the ETC using\nelectron flow, qPCR, Western blotting (WB), and measures of mtROS and cardiolipin. ETC disruption\noutcomes (ATP, glycolysis, lactic acid) will be determined. Kinetics of TCA enzymes in the presence of CPC\nwill be assessed. Super-resolution fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy will interrogate\nnanoscale CPC effects on mitochondrial morphology and PIP2 clusters and protein interactions at\nmitochondria, revealing the fundamental biology of this critical signaling lipid at the mitochondrion. Confocal\nimaging will provide another perspective, including mitochondrial translocation in the cell. We will assay CPC\neffects on mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins with qPCR, confocal of subcellular dynamics, and WB, including\nof phosphorylation status. We will determine the mechanism by which CPC affects the AMPK/mTOR pathway,\nwhich leads to mitochondrial fission, by assessing phosphorylation status with WB. We will extend the findings\nwith a proven animal model for mitochondrial research, C. elegans, assessing CPC effects on mitochondrial\nstress responses, mitochondrial membrane potential, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This research will\nuncover the mechanisms underlying CPC disruption of mitochondrial function in order to fulfill an urgent need\nby providing insights into CPC effects on environmental human health. It will also define new general modes\nof mitotoxicity for consideration in toxicity testing workflows.",

First, environmental history,\nwhich demonstrates how microbes, animals, and other forces of nature act upon history by reinforcing or\nlimiting human agency. Second, the history of medicine, which connects race, gender, and class to\nreconsider how illnesses and identities entwine. Third, science and technology studies, which emphasizes\nhow contests over expertise are shaped by engagement with material nature and cultural norms. Finally,\nsocial epidemiology, which pools diverse methodologies to evaluate the origins and distribution of disease\nand health inequities. \u201cSweet Blood\u201d connects these fields through extensive archival and primary source\nresearch to offer an important and timely reinterpretation of diabetes.\n Sweet Blood thus examines diabetes on several interlocking levels. It is a story of diabetes as\nmaterial reality, of its increase and spread over the course of the twentieth century. It is a story of the\ncreation of knowledge about diabetes to aid diagnosis, promote prevention, and assist treatment from\nclinical findings to entire populations. And it is a story of diabetes as a cultural symbol for ideas and\npractices about health, human behavior, and the environment that often generate inequalities. Sweet\nBlood blends these stories to reframe diabetes as a series of environmental relationships that change over\ntime and space. This project will result in a book (under contract) with Yale University Press.",

In the United States, disorders of the eye result in a significant economic burden for society. Because\nthe human retina has minimal or no regenerative ability, loss of retinal neurons due to intrinsic defects or\nenvironmental insults is generally irreversible, making this the most common cause of permanent visual\nimpairment. In this project, the candidate proposes to study the development of retinal ganglion cells, the\noutput projection neurons that connect the eye with the brain. These neurons are vulnerable to injury in\ntraumatic optic nerve injuries and to diseases such as glaucoma, and a deeper understanding of their\ndevelopment and regeneration could have significant implications for reversing visual impairment. In the first\npart of this application, the candidate proposes to investigate the function of a transcription factor expressed by\nretinal ganglion cells in a mouse line with this gene conditionally deleted, and by using overexpression in\nretinal progenitor cells in vivo. In the second part of this application, the candidate proposes to screen a\ncandidate list of transcription factors by overexpression in vivo for their ability to reprogram endogenous retinal\ncells to produce new retinal ganglion cells. Overall, insights from the study of normal retinal ganglion cell\ndevelopment will be applied to develop methods for replacing these cells when they are damaged or diseased.\nThe candidate\u2019s overall career goal is to understand developmental processes that shape the nervous system,\nand to apply this developmental knowledge to regenerate neurons lost to injury or disease. The candidate has\na deep background in cerebral cortical developmental biology and proposes to receive training in retinal\ndevelopment because the retina is significantly more accessible to clinical manipulation, and promising\nregenerative therapies are already beginning to come to fruition. During the mentored phase of this award, the\ncandidate will prioritize undertaking activities to increase understanding of retinal development, to do\nproductive and meaningful science, and consequently to transition research from cerebral cortical development\nto retinal development. The PI will work with mentors Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg and Dr. Sui Wang, together with\nmembers of a Stanford faculty advisory team. The proposed research and training plans will take place in the\nlaboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at Stanford University School of\nMedicine. The outstanding vision science group at Stanford is embedded within the world-class neuroscience\nand broader life sciences community at Stanford as a whole, with benefits of a close-knit and focused\ndepartment and the resources of the wider university.",

Defined as cessation of breathing for 20 seconds or longer or a shorter pause accompanied by hypoxemia, AOP is a major morbidity among preterm infants and a significant healthcare burden. AOP affects 70% of all early preterm births (<34 weeks gestational age) and nearly all at \u2264 28 weeks\u2019 gestation. In the United States in 2020, the total annual direct costs associated with AOP exceeded $12 billion. While there is no consensus for treating AOP, common interventions include positional techniques, caffeine citrate, manual tactile stimulation, and supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia. Caffeine citrate is the first line of therapy as it decreases apneic episodes and reduces the need for assisted ventilation. At recommended doses, caffeine has been proven safe and effective. However, in the sole trial supporting its FDA clearance, a majority of newborns treated with caffeine citrate continued to experience apnea events. In 2015, a clinical study using a stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) investigational device reported a 50% reduction in the number of apnea events. Prapela exclusively licensed the SVS technology of the investigational device and has demonstrated technical feasibility replicating the clinically critical stimulation in prototype incubator pads. The broad objective of this SBIR Fast-Track application is to generate the data and documentation necessary for FDA marketing clearance of a novel device to reduce apnea events in preterm newborns. To accomplish this objective, Prapela proposes four Specific Aims: 1) complete development of the SVS incubator pad, 2) demonstrate the safety of the device, 3) determine the clinical efficacy of the SVS incubator pad as an adjunctive therapy to concurrent pharmacological treatment in newborns with AOP, and 4) document the benefit-risk assessment of the device from clinicians caring for AOP patients. Efficacy will be established through a masked, randomized clinical trial with newborns of <33 weeks gestational age, with postmenstrual age (PMA) of <38 weeks at the time of enrollment. The control group will receive standard therapy only with caffeine citrate and respiratory support and an inert SVS device, while the intervention group will receive standard therapy concurrent with the Prapela SVS device. The primary outcome measure will be the mean number of apnea events in the three days after study entry, with a reduction in apnea events of 30% or more considered clinically significant. Questionnaires administered at the end of each experimental period to the clinicians present on the final shift will capture the benefit-risk assessment. The successful completion of the project will provide the data and documentation necessary for FDA marketing clearance and commercialization of our SVS incubator pad as a purpose-built device to improve clinical outcomes of preterm infants with AOP.",

Efficacy will be established through a masked, randomized clinical trial with newborns of <33 weeks gestational age, with postmenstrual age (PMA) of <38 weeks at the time of enrollment. The control group will receive standard therapy only with caffeine citrate and respiratory support and an inert SVS device, while the intervention group will receive standard therapy concurrent with the Prapela SVS device. The primary outcome measure will be the mean number of apnea events in the three days after study entry, with a reduction in apnea events of 30% or more considered clinically significant. Questionnaires administered at the end of each experimental period to the clinicians present on the final shift will capture the benefit-risk assessment. The successful completion of the project will provide the data and documentation necessary for FDA marketing clearance and commercialization of our SVS incubator pad as a purpose-built device to improve clinical outcomes of preterm infants with AOP.",

Defined as cessation of breathing for 20 seconds or longer or a shorter pause accompanied by hypoxemia, AOP is a major morbidity among preterm infants and a significant healthcare burden. AOP affects 70% of all early preterm births (<34 weeks gestational age) and nearly all at \u2264 28 weeks\u2019 gestation. In the United States in 2020, the total annual direct costs associated with AOP exceeded $12 billion. While there is no consensus for treating AOP, common interventions include positional techniques, caffeine citrate, manual tactile stimulation, and supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia. Caffeine citrate is the first line of therapy as it decreases apneic episodes and reduces the need for assisted ventilation. At recommended doses, caffeine has been proven safe and effective. However, in the sole trial supporting its FDA clearance, a majority of newborns treated with caffeine citrate continued to experience apnea events. In 2015, a clinical study using a stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) investigational device reported a 50% reduction in the number of apnea events. Prapela exclusively licensed the SVS technology of the investigational device and has demonstrated technical feasibility replicating the clinically critical stimulation in prototype incubator pads. The broad objective of this SBIR Fast-Track application is to generate the data and documentation necessary for FDA marketing clearance of a novel device to reduce apnea events in preterm newborns. To accomplish this objective, Prapela proposes four Specific Aims: 1) complete development of the SVS incubator pad, 2) demonstrate the safety of the device, 3) determine the clinical efficacy of the SVS incubator pad as an adjunctive therapy to concurrent pharmacological treatment in newborns with AOP, and 4) document the benefit-risk assessment of the device from clinicians caring for AOP patients.

Our Research Program is focused on uncovering \nthe underlying genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional mechanisms that drive aging-associated cellular \ndysfunction, chronic inflammation, and immune dysfunction, and their profound contributions to cancer. By \ndelving into these fundamental processes, we strive to gain insights into cancer development, dissemination, \nand treatment resistance to develop age-tailored interventions. Our Program has been focused on exploring \nthe genomic complexity of cancer and how the tumor and the host interact. Building on our success, we are \nnow extending these studies to include the dimension of time by incorporating aspects of aging pathobiology. \nOur research is organized around three complementary and interrelated Specific Aims. Aim 1 seeks to \nuncover cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms contributing to tumor progression and treatment resistance and how \naging impacts them. Aim 2 seeks to dissect the complexity of immune and stromal components of the tumor \nmicroenvironment and their associations with genetics and aging. Aim 3 seeks to decipher and modulate \naging-associated pathology at the organismal level to prevent tumor progression and treatment resistance. All \nthree Aims draw on the JAXCC\u2019s longstanding strengths in the genetics, development, and analysis of \norganismal, cellular, and computational models, with a focus on how aging and genetic background contribute \nto the physiology of cancer.

The overall goal of\nThe Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center (JAX NSC) Research Development Core is to provide support\nfor the career development of junior faculty entering the field of basic aging biology or other investigators who\nwish to change career direction toward basic aging research. During the current funding period, the JAX NSC\nResearch Development Core competitively awarded funding and resources to aging projects using the mouse\nas a biological system. These projects resulted in new discoveries, research publications and sources of funding,\nand helped junior awardees establish their own independent careers in aging research. Moving forward, these\nsuccesses will be expanded by providing targeted funding to exciting projects proposed by investigators new to\naging research, and by offering a variety of research and intellectual resources to support awardees and other\ninvestigators in their work. The outstanding institutional resources available at JAX, a premier institution for\nmouse genetics and systems biology research, will be leveraged to sustain and grow this foundation of\nresearchers at JAX and within the aging community. The Specific Aims of this Core are: Aim 1. Provide support\nfor projects by new investigators in aging research using a competitive pilot award program. Promising\ninvestigators new to aging research will be funded through a competitive process so they can generate the data\nand gain the expertise necessary to support competitive funding applications and a transition to a career in aging\nbiology. Aim 2. Provide resources to support pilot awardees and investigators new to aging research.\nAccess to resources (e.g., aged mice, data, tissues, phenotype platforms, expertise) will be provided to support\npilot awardees and other investigators new to aging research. The aged mouse cohorts and phenotyping\ntechnologies supported by the JAX NSC present a valuable opportunity for investigators to access material and\ncollect data that might otherwise be prohibitively expensive or difficult to obtain. Aim 3. Provide mentorship,\ntraining, and career development opportunities in aging research. Investigators new to aging research will\nbe provided with mentorship by JAX NSC researchers and collaborators. They will also be given opportunities\nfor career development in the aging field via support with the grant writing process, opportunities to participate\nin aging meetings, and introductions to potential collaborations within the broader geroscience community.

The program has three specific aims. 1) Funding: The DRPP will provide competitive funding for Research Projects (RPs), Pilot Projects (PPs), and Collaborative Pilot Projects (CPPs) that involve students in innovative biomedical research. RP Leaders, who are newly appointed or early-career faculty, will dedicate 50% of their effort to their projects. PP Leaders can be faculty members at any career stage from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), devoting 25% effort. CPP Leaders will form multi-disciplinary teams involving scientists from different INBRE network institutions. Funding duration varies, with RPs spanning two years and PPs funded for one year, with the possibility of one competitive renewal contingent on progress. 2) Mentoring: Project Leaders will be partnered with and receive guidance from experienced mentors. RPs will have both an internal mentor from their institution and an external mentor in their research field. PPs will typically have a single mentor. Project Leaders will also participate in workshops on data science, grant writing, lab management, and other relevant topics, fostering their career development. 3) Evaluation: The DRPP will undergo rigorous evaluation to ensure its effectiveness. Project Leaders will submit progress reports, and the DRPP Director and the Evaluation Team will assess project progress toward publications, major grant proposals, and mentoring effectiveness using a prescribed evaluation matrix. The External Advisory Committee will conduct semiannual evaluations and provide personalized feedback to the Project Leaders and their mentors, ensuring their continued success. The ME-INBRE DRPP prioritizes innovative projects, particularly those with data science components, engaging undergraduate students and leveraging core resources from ME-INBRE and other IDeA programs in Maine and the region like the Maine COBREs and Northern New England CTR. The program's impact will be to increase the amount of and capacity for high-quality biomedical research in Maine. It will do so by supporting innovative investigator-initiated research and pilot projects, both standalone and collaborative, and through effective mentorship and research oversight. The program will also promote collaborations across ME-INBRE network institutions.",

However, one challenge is limited access to consolidated state-of-the-art and rapidly advancing research resources, education, and technologies. The NNE-CTR now provides innovative and integrated shared technical resources at partner institutions to cost-effectively support approaches with education and training for optimal use by investigators and trainees in academic medical centers, practice- based research networks (PBRNs), and industry throughout the region. We have consolidated strategic core facilities by leveraging expertise in genomic/epigenomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and imaging technologies with emphasis towards molecular diagnostics/precision medicine. Building upon our success, the goals of the Translational Research and Technologies Core (TRTC) are to provide investigators with support for research based on genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, cell and tissue analyses, molecular diagnostics and novel mouse models for preclinical studies. Our secondary goal is to advance collaborative partnerships among scientists, behaviorists, and physician investigators and support the career development of biomedical researchers. Coordinating with the Community Engagement and Outreach Core, the TRTC will expand educational efforts to facilitate bidirectional communication and to foster collaborations and discovery in translational and clinical research. This research infrastructure, with expanded faculty development in translational and clinical research, will also strengthen the interactions and engagement with the NNE-PBRN and other clinician investigators to support mechanistic and clinical investigations of cancer, cardiovascular disease, substance abuse and other diseases prevalent in the northern New England rural population. Furthermore, the TRTC will build upon established IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) programs and multiple Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE), to effectively leverage resources established by these programs for the enhancement of young and established investigators. The TRTC is currently supporting the development of genomic and cellular imaging-based diagnostics for future public health challenges. TRTC will also support Department of Health initiatives in partnering states and private sector endeavors that likely will require molecular diagnostics. In summary, the TRTC, by integrating unique and essential biomedical research expertise, technologies, and services, will enhance research capacity, credential research programs, and increase the competitiveness of investigators in the region for the benefit of northern New England institutions and the people they serve.",

Thus, acute care encompasses multiple medical\nspecialties, including critical care services, emergency and urgent care, trauma and acute care surgery, and\nneurocritical care. In rural states, the need for improvements in acute care and acute care research are\npressing, as medical advances have increased the disparities between urban and rural areas. These\ndisparities are due in large part to imbalances in access to specialty-trained clinicians, resources and facilities,\nas well as clinical research. We propose a new inter-departmental Center for Biomedical Research Excellence\n(COBRE) at Maine Medical Center, a tertiary care center located in the largest population center (Portland) in\nthe state of Maine. Serving as the hub of activities, this program will mentor cohorts of acute care researchers\nin significant clinical/translational areas of need while providing a foundation for these studies to impact\ncommunities and patients in all regions of our state. This COBRE is led by Douglas Sawyer MD, PhD, an\nestablished leader in clinical care services, mentorship, and translational research. The aims of this program\nare: 1) Provide the leadership, governance, and advisory network to establish a COBRE in Acute Care\nResearch and Rural Disparities at Maine Medical Center; 2) Provide project and mentorship support to launch\nthe careers of promising clinician-scientists within this scientific program, and help ensure their long-term\nscientific success as independent researchers; 3) Enhance the capabilities of Maine Medical Center's core\nfacilities and research infrastructure to support human subject research of both our COBRE investigators and\nother institutional and external researchers, and to stimulate innovative research methodologies and new\ncollaborations, and 4) Enhance our existing COBRE- and CTR-supported pilot project programs to focus on\ntranslational and clinical opportunities related to acute care and rural health disparities.

Tools for human studies\nhave advanced greatly yet there remains a necessary reliance on mammalian models. To this end new strains\nof mice have been created that better emulate the extent of human genetic variation. These strains include\nCollaborative Cross (CC), Diversity Outbred (DO) and recombinant inbred mice (e.g. BXD). The CC/DO and\nBXD platforms harness the natural inbred strain variation needed for systems genetics studies. However, the\nuse of these strains typically requires additional genetic engineering of the mice to create \u201ctool strains\u201d to allow\nspecific types of genetic manipulations. Such strains already exist for standard inbred strains (e.g. C57BL/6J),\nbut \u201ctool strains\u201d, that carry commonly needed genetic manipulations, are not presently available for genetically\ndiverse inbred strains such as CC/DO, BXD, or all of the founder inbred strains used to create these RI panels.\n The use of the powerful CC/DO/BXD strains is growing rapidly and to facilitate efficient use of these mice we\npropose to create a series of tool strains and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). To do this, we will take\nadvantage of diverse inbred strains that harbor novel, high efficiency recombinase-based docking sites to\nfacilitate the use of CRISPR-cas9 editing for creation of the new strains. Validated new tool strains will be\nmade available through the Special Mouse Strain Resource (SMSR).\n To achieve this goal we will:\n Derive and validate germ line competent mESC lines from existing Bxb1 integrase strains. The goal\nhere is to create a panel of genetically diverse mESC lines harboring Bxb1 integrase sites, as well as LSL-\nCas9-FLAG. These mESCs will provide tools for engineering loci that are difficult to engineer in zygotes or for\nvalidation experiments that can be accomplished in vitro.\n Generate Rosa26-LSL-Cas9-FLAG tool strains for CAST/EiJ, PWK/EiJ, and DBA/2J inbred strains.\nThese strains will enable CRISPR/cas9 editing in the absence of exogenous Cas9. This facilitates engineering\nin zygotes and allows for easy, precise engineering of somatic cells/tissues. The goal is to create and validate\nthis important tool strain for the three high priority inbred strain backgrounds listed above.\n Generate germ line deletion tool strains for CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ inbred strain backgrounds.\nRemoval of specific DNA sequences or engineering stop codons is frequently accomplished using flanking\nloxP sites that serve as catalytic domains for cre recombinase. Implementation of this approach frequently\nuses \u201cgerm line cre\u201d strains, that are not currently available on genetically diverse strain backgrounds. Thus,\nthe goal here is to take advantage of our Bxb1 docking site strains to create Rosa26 Sox2-cre knock-in alleles\non CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ.",

Defects or dysfunction in cell signaling are\nfundamental drivers of human disease, and our ability to meet contemporary clinical challenges, including\nneurodegenerative and metabolic disease, chronic pain and optimizing healthy aging, requires a broader understanding of\nmechanisms of intercellular and intracellular communication. The proposed UNE Center for Cell Signaling Research\n(CCSR) will build a critical mass of talented investigators with a broad research emphasis on cellular metabolism,\ninflammation and aging. The initial Research Project Leaders (RPLs), selected through a competitive process, bring\ndiverse and complementary expertise from across UNE colleges and departments. Their research projects address discrete\nclinical challenges by investigating fundamental cell biological mechanisms that may have broad ramifications for human\ndisease. New faculty recruitment and support of a pilot project program will ensure a continued pipeline of RPLs and\nfurther grow the Center. Investigators will be provided with a structured mentorship program to support both their\nprofessional and research program development in their progression to independent funding and beyond. The proposed\nCenter will also expand the research infrastructure at UNE to support the innovative research programs of investigators\nin cell signaling. The proposed In Vitro Analytical Core will support the research of the RPLs with outstanding\ninstrumentation and innovative services that are not broadly available elsewhere in the region, including primary cell and\ncell line culturing, transfection and analysis through functional imaging as well as transcriptional and protein-based\nanalysis. The core will be housed in newly renovated research space that will be contiguous with an existing UNE\nHistology and Imaging Core, providing a unique suite of resources to support research at UNE. Institutional commitments\ninclude additional protected research time for RPLs and institutional matching funds for the pilot project program. In\naddition, the university has committed to hiring 3 additional investigators whose research programs will complement\nthose of the existing faculty. The Center will also benefit from strong continued institutional investment into research\ninfrastructure, as well as well-established collaborations with neighboring IDeA state programs in Maine and New\nHampshire. Research infrastructure will be enhanced by laboratory renovations, purchasing new instrumentation, and key\nsupport for personnel. Additional institutional support has been committed for each of these. With sound financial and\nadministrative management and regular assessments of performance with specified bench marks, the CCSR will be well-\npositioned to make a significant impact in optimizing healthy, pain-free aging and in finding new treatments for\nneurodegenerative and metabolic diseases.",

Our focus on developing basic biomedical\nresearch to support translational programs has been supported by the formation of Centers of Biomedical\nResearch Excellence (2000-present), and in 2017, a multi-institute Northern New England Clinical and\nTranslational Research Network to establish infrastructure required for extending clinical research efforts. We\nhave maintained a focus on medical training programs, with prominent academic affiliations with Tufts\nUniversity School of Medicine, with 40 of their medical students in a Maine Track program and 20 ongoing\nresidency and fellowship programs. Of note, recent expansions in graduate medical education include the\naddition of a Rural Track in our Internal Medicine residency, and an enhanced focus on research as part of\nresidency and fellowships. These efforts have been bolstered by institutional investments to support medical\nstudents and physicians in expanded options for research, and the alignment of research mentors with these\ncommitments. Research and clinical strengths at Maine Medical Center include topics of high relevance to the\nmission of the NHLBI, including vessel wall biology, vascular development, myocardial injury, heart failure,\nvascular progenitor cells, vascular inflammation, adipose/vascular interactions, endothelial dysfunction and\ncardiovascular disease; and clinical research addressing cardiac arrest, cystic fibrosis, hemorrhagic shock,\nvascular complications of trauma, and genetics/epidemiology of disease. This proposal requests the needed\nsupport to fulfill the objective of the NHLBI to develop the biomedical research workforce focusing on a unique\npopulation of medical students in Maine. This proposal requests funds to focus on providing rigorous, full-time\nsummer research training experiences for Maine Track medical students. While some of those students may\nalready have an interest in research, this new program will broaden our educational scope to include\ntranslational biomedical research. Currently, all Maine Track students are required to complete a scholarly\nproject as part of their medical training, and we have an established infrastructure to support research\nexperiences in the summer after the first year of study. Our vision is to enhance this pipeline to increase our\ncommunity of rigorously trained physicians who are comfortable working across the basic-translational-clinical\nresearch spectrum to promote public health. While this is a long-term and ambitious goal, it is even more\npressing in an environment such as the rural state of Maine, which does not have a portfolio of large academic\nmedical centers that attract a high number of medical students, residents or fellows interested in translational\nresearch.

The long-term goal is to increase the\ndiversity of next-generation scientists that can use cutting edge genetics and genomics techniques to study\naddiction. To achieve this goal, trainee recruitment efforts will target institutions serving significant\nunderrepresented minority (URM) populations and faculty who themselves are URM. This training program\nconsist of two components. To begin, participants will first complete a customized, virtual mentored course\ndesigned to deliver foundational skills and knowledge in mammalian and systems genetics of addiction. The\nvirtual course will combine newly-derived content combined with material derived from several of JAX's signature\ncourses including the McKusick Human and Mammalian Genetics Short Course, and the Short Course on the\nGenetics of Addiction, and from established JAX online educational modules including The Basics of Mouse\nGenetics, and Complex Traits. Then, a subset of course participants will be invited to return to JAX with 2 trainees\n(post-doctoral, graduate or undergraduate) for an extended summer research experience mentored by hosting\nJAX faculty. Faculty-trainee teams will be hosted at JAX by program mentors, where they will make use of JAXs\nadvanced research resources to learn techniques needed to augment their research into addiction related\nphenomena through the incorporation of mammalian genetics and genomics. They will return to their home\ninstitutions with knowledge, skills, data and resources to support follow-on research, presentations, publications\nand grant applications. This model will foster the career development of URM faculty as well as both the\nparticipating young scientist-trainees and the future trainees of the URM faculty member. The program is\ndesigned to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide foundational education in mammalian genetics and\nsystems genetics of addiction through virtual, mentored instruction. 2) Engage diverse faculty and student teams\nin summer mentored research projects utilizing advanced methods and resources for addiction genetics. 3)\nRecruit individuals from underrepresented minority groups to participate in the virtual course, mentored research\nexperiences, and career development skills training. Impact: Successful completion of these aims will result in\nan expanded number of addiction researchers from URM groups who are actively working with model organism\ngenetics and genomics to understand and characterize mechanisms of addiction related behavior. Educational\nmaterials will be made broadly available, and a select group of investigators will advance to develop specific\ngenetic and genomic research programs with support in the use of emerging technologies in these fields. The\neffectiveness of this novel program will be evaluated and if successful, may be used as a model for expanded\ndeployment in other research fields or institutions.",

Despite considerable effort to date, there is currently a lack of interventions or cure, thus there is a clear need for a better understanding of the heterogenous disease phenotypes and the underlying genetics to identify more effective preclinical strategies. Rapidly expanding genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic data sets, and emerging animal models of AD created by the Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (MODEL-AD) consortium, now provide new tools for accelerating our understanding of AD and enable interspecies analysis for mapping findings from mouse model systems of AD to human omics signatures. While multi-omics data sets derived from AD and animal models of AD are available to the scientific community through various data ecosystems including the AD Knowledge Portal, a NIA designated FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data repository, a current barrier is mapping disease relevant molecular signatures between model organisms and humans. Thus, there is an emerging need to provide training in bioinformatics methodologies for systematic interspecies translation of omics-derived signatures of AD. To address this need, we aim to provide a new, and increasingly multidisciplinary, generation of researchers, with awareness of available resources and to provide skills development for integrating multi-scale data from model systems and humans to advance AD research and interventions. We propose a unique, annual, 4-day workshop at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), that will leverage trainers and expertise from Sage Bionetwork, the host institution for The AD Knowledge Portal and Exceptional Longevity Data Management and Coordinating Center, and the MODEL-AD Center at JAX. The proposed workshop, Computational Techniques and Resources for Effective Translational Research in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, will focus on enabling utilization of omics-driven computational techniques and analytical principles for cross species functional alignment. Active learning programming sessions will be the core of the workshop, in combination with lectures and interactive forums. Participants will emerge from the workshop equipped with the knowledge and technical skills to conduct rigorous and reproducible computational research for more effective translational strategies in AD. To achieve this, we propose the following aims: 1) foster utilization of existing data resources from human and model organism studies in AD; 2) deliver hands-on training on computational techniques that reinforce rigor and reproducibility principles for translational AD research, and; 3) create an engaging environment for trainees that fosters networking, collaboration, and experiential learning..\n.",

Our long-term goal is to develop novel genetic models for\naddiction-relevant phenotypes, and use these models to characterize the genetic mechanisms of addiction. We\npropose to leverage the Jackson Laboratory Knockout Mouse Project 2 (JAX KOMP2) pipeline to prioritize\naddiction gene candidates, and then characterize the effects of candidate gene knockouts on addiction-related\nbehaviors and on addiction-relevant tissues.

Multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that results from\nmutated plasma cells, grows in the rich soil of the bone marrow causing breakdown of the bone. The risk of\ndeveloping myeloma is greater in older individuals and people with high body mass index who also typically\nhave more bone marrow adipose tissue, or fat, than younger or leaner individuals. However, the relationship\nbetween bone marrow adipocytes (fat cells) and myeloma cells, as well as the specific mechanisms by which\nbone marrow adipocytes modulate myeloma disease progression are not well understood. Therefore, we aim\nto identify novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients by unlocking new\nvulnerabilities specific to the interactions between myeloma cells and bone marrow adipocytes, which can\nserve as a source of fatty acids and pro-myeloma cytokines. Our cell culture studies suggest bone marrow\nadipocytes induce drug resistance in myeloma cells- recapitulating a common problem for myeloma patients.\nWe have found that one mechanism of cross-talk linking adipocytes with myeloma cells is through proteins\ncalled fatty acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FABP4 and FABP5). We will analyze how bone marrow adipocytes\ncontribute to myeloma by using novel, three-dimensional (3D), tissue engineered cancer models which\nconsist of bone marrow adipocytes and myeloma cells grown together on silk scaffolds. By growing myeloma\ncells in these 3D mini-bone environments, we can determine how myeloma cells change in response to\nadipocytes and discover new ways to target this interaction. We will also use our novel mouse models to\nstudy bone marrow adipocyte- myeloma crosstalk by increasing or removing bone marrow adipocytes in mice\nand quantifying effects on tumor growth and drug resistance. We will use these in vitro and in vivo models to\nspecifically test the role of FABP4 and FABP5 in tumor progression and drug resistance, and work toward our\nlong-term goal to better understand the molecules and mechanisms driving multiple myeloma growth in the\nbone marrow, and how cancer hijacks this niche for its own purposes. This proposal supports this endeavor\nby providing support for a Research Specialist to further develop, lead, and execute the experiments\ndescribed which interrogate a novel part of the cellular \u201csoil\u201d (the bone marrow adipocyte), in which tumor\ncells, or \u201cseeds\u201d land and grow.",

Moreover, the\nopioid epidemic, that has only increased in severity as a consequence of COVID-19, lends urgency to the search for\nalternative treatments for moderate to severe pain. Through Phase 1 and 2 COBRE funding and leveraged institutional\nsupport, the University of New England (UNE) Center for the Study of Pain and Sensory Function was successful in\nrenovating new laboratory space, establishing two research core facilities, and recruiting a critical mass of investigators\nstudying pain and its treatment.

The Pilot Project\nProgram will accept applications from faculty at UNE and regional partner institutions to support projects that utilize the\ncore facilities and have the potential to lead to extramural funding. This approach will increase the research core user base\nand assist in Aim 2, transitioning the research cores into sustainable resources that provide expertise, training, and state-\nof-the-art instrumentation to the UNE and broader scientific communities for conducting cutting-edge biomedical\nresearch. The research cores will become sustainable through collaborations with regional COBREs and Maine INBRE\npartners, the combined efforts of the External Advisory and Steering Committees, strong institutional support, and an\naggressive business strategic planning and marketing approach. COBRE Phases 1 and 2 profoundly transformed the\nresearch environment at UNE. At the time of Phase 1 submission, core research facilities were nonexistent. The increase\nin research capacity created through the COBRE program has led to the recruitment and funding of a critical mass of\ninvestigators, training of a skilled workforce, and development of sustainable core research facilities that can support\nhigh-quality research for UNE faculty and students, as well as external academic and industry partners. With continued\ninstitutional investment and additional support provided through Phase 3 funding, we will build on this early success and\nestablish our center as a leader in pain research for many years to come.",

Lack of\nexposure to scientific research resources and mentors, economic factors, and cultural biases are barriers that\nlimit access to quality science education and, in turn, hinder the expansion of our nation's research capacity by\nlimiting contributions from a deep pool of intellectual talent.\nThe program will benefit from JAX's nine decades of success in training scientists at all career stages, including\nthose from underrepresented groups, by its world-leading mouse genetic, genomic, and computational\nresources, and by its well-funded and productive faculty. The program will build upon programmatic infrastructure\nfor career development and a community of post-bacc peers from an existing post-bacc program at JAX. The\ngenomics DAP will be distinct from the existing post-bacc program as the focus for the proposed program will\nbe specifically on career development for basic research in the areas of genomics, genome technology, and data\nscience.\nThe program will host up to six post-baccalaureate fellows in a year with individuals distributed across the Bar\nHarbor, Maine and Farmington, Connecticut JAX campuses. The three primary aims for the program will be (1)\nProvide two-year mentored post-baccalaureate research experiences in genomics, genome technologies, and\ndata science for individuals from underrepresented minority groups; (2) Implement a curriculum that provides\nknowledge, skills, and training complementary to the mentored laboratory research experience and, (3)\nIncorporate formal and informal evaluation methods to strengthen the training program. Oversight for the\nprogram will be provided by two PIs, one from each campus, and by Program Staff from the JAX Genomic\nEducation team. An Advisory Council comprised of internal and external individuals will evaluate the program's\neffectiveness and provide guidance on sustaining a research workplace that is inclusive and equitable.\nThe alumni from the post-bacc program will contribute to building a research workforce that is representative of\nour nation's population.

Our Center in Phase I developed a critical mass of investigators with biomedical research interests in metabolic health and disease, focusing on adipose tissue, bone and skeletal biology, and environmental, neural, and pharmacological inputs that regulate these tissues. Our COBRE also supported three scientific core facilities \u2013 Physiology, Histopathology, and Proteomics and Lipidomics cores. These scientific core facilities provide outstanding services, and have responsibility for maintaining state-of-the-art technologies in their respective areas by updating technology, equipment, and maintaining current knowledge. In addition, scientific core facilities are responsible for the training of staff, and assisting in experimental design, project implementation and data analysis. We established a robust mentoring network for our junior investigators, and engaged an external advisory committee to evaluate projects, cores, and our overall Center. Our investment in Phase I COBRE projects and pilot projects thus far has directly yielded six NIH R01 awards (original four junior investigator project leads were funded) with seven COBRE members, one NSF CAREER award, one NIH S10 instrumentation grant, and one foundation research grant. Two COBRE members also mentor PhD students who were awarded NIH F31 fellowships during this time. In year four of Phase I, we held a national faculty recruitment that yielded two outstanding new junior investigators who joined our COBRE; one in August 2021 (Matt Lynes PhD), and one in August 2022 (Ziru Li PhD). In addition to Drs. Lynes and Li, Phase II supports a third new junior investigator project lead, Dr. Isha Agarwal. These new project leads bring expertise in thermogenic adipocytes, a gut-bone signaling axis, and impact of night shift work on diabetes risk in pregnant women. Our Phase II program will build upon our successful leadership, mentorship and professional development model. We will focus on expanding our portfolio of research and scientific resources under the guidance of an Advisory Committee. Goals for Phase II of this COBRE in Metabolic Networks are: 1) Provide leadership to evolve a robust Center infrastructure with administrative, fiscal and scientific management to support growth of collaborative research and resources in metabolic health and disease, 2) Support career advancement for COBRE investigators and alumni, and 3) Maintain high quality shared scientific resources. Successful achievement of these goals will support professional development of promising junior investigators while expanding the use of well-regarded scientific shared research resources, which are already highly utilized by a researcher user base throughout the country.",

            "project_description": "Maine ranks 12th and 8th in adult cancer incidence and mortality respectively, and pediatric cancer incidence rates are the third highest in the nation, contributing to challenging access to cancer care in our state. In 2018, it is estimated there will be 8,600 new adult cancer cases diagnosed in Maine; cancer is the most common cause of death in our state. Of these adult cases, 6,185 (72%) will receive their care at a MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) hospital or outpatient facility. This patient volume is akin to any major metropolitan cancer center. With only 1.3 million residents, Maine is a small state, is the most rural state, and has the oldest population in the nation. There are significant cancer risk behaviors and exposures, and there are numerous socioeconomic and geographic challenges as well, further compounding our cancer burden. The MHCCN is clearly organized around patient, health provider, and healthcare system multi-tiered strategies and interventions that are prioritized in the NCORP solicitation and defended in this proposal. Our health system embarked upon a comprehensive oncology strategic planning process in 2014 that in a relatively short period has led to the opportunity to submit our response to this FOA. Consensus was reached on the model of cancer care that we would pursue. The singular goal is to ensure that \"the right care, in the right location, as close to home as possible\" will be provided. Cancer patients in our state and their families desire access to state-of-the-art patient-centered care. This NCORP application could not come at a more auspicious time for our organization, coinciding with significant growth and substantive multi-million dollar investment in MH Oncology over the past couple years. With this backdrop, the fundamental goal of our application is to commit and contribute to a robust slate of NCORP activities across the lifespan including pediatric, adolescent and young adults, adults, and elderly cancer patients in our communities and rural care settings. We have assembled a highly interactive and interdisciplinary team across our network to participate in and lead this research endeavor. Our central hypothesis is that developing a highly interactive and interdisciplinary approach to cancer care that is at all times patient-centered throughout MH Oncology will have salutary effects on all aspects of our cancer care across the continuum of prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, end-of-life, and care delivery not only for our patients and their families but for other aspects critical to our mission \u2013 including educating the next generation of healthcare providers and expanding our research pursuits especially in rural areas within our care network. We propose 4 aims: To conduct and actively participate in 1) cancer control research, 2) cancer prevention research, and 3) cancer care delivery research studies; and 4) to capitalize upon clinical research opportunities afforded by NCORP and our newly awarded Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network grant (1U54 GM115517). We will pursue these aims across the lifespan engaging both children and adults. The MHCNN has every expectation that will we make substantive contributions across the spectrum of the NCORP research portfolio. We will capitalize on our institutional assets, patient resources, and expertise from the vantage point of community and rural settings to add value across the lifespan and provide leadership to the NCORP. We welcome and value the opportunity to join the NCORP network as a new institutional member.",

Every human suffers fibrotic scarring in their lifetime, and fibrosis accounts for over 45% of human deaths, due to organ failure. Thus, there is a great need for therapies that improve wound healing and tissue regeneration. While the regenerative-biology field has grown exponentially over recent decades, largely due to technical advances such as CRISPR and next-generation sequencing, this growth has not seen corresponding growth in the workforce. We believe that the best approach to develop such a workforce is to train scientists using a cross-species approach, enabling them to understand regeneration by studying organisms that differ in regeneration capacity to identify common and distinct tissue-regeneration processes. A knowledge of regeneration also requires an understanding of the unique developmental biology across these organisms. Our program is designed for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career scientists. We will implement our program via three aims. In Aim 1 we will offer an annual ten-day research training course and networking symposium focused on the inter-relationship between regenerative and developmental-biology research. The course will include hands-on laboratory training using animal models that differ in regeneration capacity; keynote lectures and other activities designed to promote interactions among Program participants; bioinformatics, microscopy, and Responsible Conduct of Research training; and a half-day weekend symposium to provide course participants and ReBilD Program alumni with opportunities to network and present their research. In Aim 2 we will establish a year-round Visiting Scientist Program enabling course alumni and other researchers to spend up to four weeks at MDIBL and work alongside our lab members to receive additional, focused research training using advanced methodologies such as transgenesis on one or more of the model organisms used in the 10-day course. In Aim 3 we will establish a sustainable community of interdisciplinary ReBilD researchers, by establishing strong mentoring for all participants and creating an online networking forum that will provide multiple resources such as course materials to ReBilD Program students, faculty, invited speakers, and other regeneration/developmental biology researchers, and will create an online networking and discussion forum for long-term, post-program interactions, including mentoring, and for further expanding this community. Our program will also include annual mid-year career-development and grant-writing workshops; a seminar series in regeneration and development; and an outcome-assessment plan. Together, the elements of our ReBilD Program will create a workforce well-positioned to make discoveries in their own laboratories and to further expand this research community.",

Drug addiction is a devastating and complex disorder influenced by multiple etiological factors. Extensive evidence demonstrates the role of genetic variation on a range of addiction behaviors, from experimentation and initiation of drug use to compulsive drug-taking behavior. Yet discovery of predisposing genes and variants in human populations is limited by high sample size requirements, phenotyping capacity, and variability in drug exposure and other environmental factors. Advanced mouse genetic populations exhibit variation in addiction-relevant behaviors and offer an experimental platform to discover the neurobiological mechanisms by which predisposing traits predict the tendency to self-administer cocaine. The CSNA employs the Collaborative Cross mouse genetic reference population and Diversity Outbred mouse mapping population across three integrated research projects focused on three interrelated aspects of addiction susceptibility: impulsivity, cocaine sensitization and self-administration. These traits are evaluated using a multidimensional phenotyping platform in a mouse population exhibiting extreme genetic and phenotypic variation, enabling a replicable and extensible assessment of the shared and distinct biological mechanisms of addiction vulnerability. These complementary populations are derived from the same founder strains, allowing for extensive data integration across studies within and outside the CSNA. The CSNA develops data integration methods and produces multiple functional genomics and phenomics datasets, deposited in widely accessed and highly functional informatics resources for the global research community. The Center also extends its results into basic neurobiological and preclinical therapeutic research by integrating findings with human genetic and genomic studies, generating novel, validated mouse mutants and identifying vulnerable and resistant strains for mechanistic studies. Three research support cores provide state-of-the-art approaches to the CSNA research projects and the larger research community, including a sophisticated, large-capacity Behavioral Phenotyping Core, an Integrative Genetics and Genomics Core for statistical genetics, molecular profiling, biobanking, data integration and data dissemination, and a Mouse Resource and Validation Core for creating and delivering novel mouse resources for systems genetics, validation, and disease modeling. The Administrative Core coordinates, integrates, and disseminates research, education and outreach activities. Through its combined efforts, the CSNA will have a lasting impact on the study of addiction genetics through the holistic examination of biobehavioral risk, the generation of community data resources that we and others will expand and exploit in future studies, and through education and training.",

Moreover, there are unmet needs to lower the barriers to\nparticipation in advantageous training by diverse and disadvantaged learner groups, to provide equitable access\nand, in alignment with stated NIH priorities, to train and diversify the biomedical workforce. To help address this,\nThe Jackson Laboratory (JAX) proposes to provide a traveling workshop, entitled Foundational Training in the\nUse of the Laboratory Mouse as a Model of Human Disease, to be held at partner minority-serving institutions\n(MSI). This workshop will provide learning and skills development focused on fundamental techniques that are\nemployed across a wide variety of animal research and animal models of human disease. The proposed Aims\nof the workshop are: (1) To deliver foundational, experiential, training in the use of the laboratory mouse that\nparticipants can apply to their research and that will facilitate their career development; and (2) To facilitate\nengagement, active learning, and skills development by diverse and disadvantaged learners by partnering with\nMSI to bring hands-on workshops and experiential learning to their institutions. Participants completing this\nworkshop will obtain valuable exposure, perspective, and skills in the use of laboratory mice for biomedical\nresearch and as models of human disease and they will learn techniques that they can apply to their research\nand that will facilitate their career development. JAX is uniquely positioned to execute these traveling workshops:\nthe program will be facilitated by certified and experienced lead instructors from JAX and mobile lab equipment\nhas already been acquired in order to be able to hold this workshop at any partner institution that has basic lab\nspace and a vivarium. Indeed, we have successfully piloted this program at a partner MSI, with highly positive\nparticipant feedback.

The course will be held August 2023 through\n2027 on the MDI Biological Laboratory campus in Bar Harbor, Maine. The proposed course provides renal fellows\nwith hands-on research education in fundamental concepts of homeostasis and exposes them to the classical\nexperiments that form the foundation of renal physiology and nephrology.\nEight course modules are proposed: glomerular filtration and genetics of renal disease, proximal tubule function,\nthick ascending limb, salt secretion and balance, collecting duct sodium transport/ENaC, water homeostasis,\nrenal stone disease, and acid/base homeostasis. Each of the eight modules runs in three consecutive two-day\nrotations (Monday-Tuesday, Wednesday-Thursday, and Friday-Saturday), with the first day of each rotation\ninvolving intensive experimental work, and the second day involving analysis and presentation of the work to the\nentire course group. Each participant will complete three of the eight planned modules during the three rotations.\nA case study-based Responsible Conduct in Research program will be included in the schedule for all\nparticipants.\nOrigins of Renal Physiology is entirely unique among national renal short courses. The course provides\nparticipants with research tools that give them a deeper understanding of concepts of physiological homeostasis\nwhich is difficult to attain during normal clinical training schedules. The course is open to renal fellows and, since\n2010, on a space-available basis, medical residents entering nephrology. Fellows and residents alike benefit\nfrom close interactions with senior investigators in renal physiology who lead the course modules. Residents, in\nparticular, benefit by working with fellows from different programs and sharing their insights into renal research\nand nephrology.\nThe course is described on the MDI Biological Laboratory website, and in a recent editorial in J.

Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback, the current project will extend this 5-day\ncourse into a longer, two-week short course at the MDI Biological Laboratory that will feature a low student-to-\ninstructor ratio (5:1), more hands-on experiential learning, and exceptional faculty who are highly experienced\nin teaching and performing big-data analyses. The new course is designed to accommodate ~35 trainees per\nyear (175 total over the five-year R25 project). It will incorporate modules on biostatistics, scientific rigor and\nreproducibility, and FAIR data principles. The course design will also involve a short conceptual presentation,\nfollowed by an exercise in which students will gain confidence by applying a new skill. Each active-learning\nsession will have three levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) to allow each student to\nprogress at their own pace. The low student-to-faculty ratio will allow course facilitators to guide participants\nthrough realistic challenges without causing frustration. The specific aims of the proposed course include:\nSpecific Aim 1. Develop a two-week short course primarily for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students that\nimproves their ability to design and analyze omics experiments such as RNA-seq, 16S (microbiome),\nmetagenomics, and sc-RNA-seq data; Specific Aim 2. Enhance the impact of research by biomedical\nscientists by teaching them the Responsible Conduct of Research, the secure and ethical use of data, as well\nas rigor and reproducibility and FAIR data principles; Specific Aim 3. Disseminate the training curriculum to a\nbroad audience; and Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of the course on students,\nincluding a long-term follow-up to determine students\u2019 confidence in and actual integration of bioinformatics,\nbiostatistics, and FAIR data principles into their research, and the reported impact of this course on their career\ntrajectory and competitiveness in the job market. In summary, the proposed course will provide a unique cross-\ntraining, educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core\ncompetency in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large data sets.",

This week-long course will focus on developing conceptual knowledge and practical\nanalytical techniques centered around rigorous analysis of Common Fund datasets. Our course will also focus\non building the soft skills needed to work effectively in collaborative research teams. Experts from Common Fund\nprojects including SenNet, KOMP2, GTEx, and the Metabolomics Workbench will serve as instructors and\nmentors in the course. Our goal is to build an educational program that cultivates rigorous, reproducible practices\nin managing and analyzing large-scale molecular data from the Common Fund while fostering effective,\nproductive research teams and long-term collaborations.

About 25% of children in Maine have special healthcare needs, and it is estimated that one in three has a body weight designation of overweight or obese. As is typical in rural states, health care services are clustered in more densely populated southern parts of the state and along the coast, leaving large areas of Maine in the north and in the interior with less access to care. Rural Maine children have limited opportunities to participate in high-quality pediatric clinical trials. Through this application, \u201cEnvironmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes in Maine (ECHO-ME),\u201d MaineHealth seeks to join the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) in the coming five-year funding cycle. To achieve the goals of the ECHO-ISPCTN, we propose the following aims: (1) Develop, conduct, and disseminate findings from multicenter clinical trials research, assuring the participation of children living in rural communities in Maine; (2) Build pediatric clinical trial research capacity in the MaineHealth system; and (3) Engage multiple interested parties across Maine such as community members, families with lived experience, nonprofit organizations, and professional societies to enhance ECHO-ISPCTN clinical trial impact, transferability, rigor, and feasibility. Participating in this network would build lasting capacity, infrastructure, and processes in Maine to design and conduct multisite clinical trials that answer questions of critical importance to pediatric health; increase the ability of rural children to participate in clinical research through MaineHealth (which serves about one-third of children in Maine); and allow the research team to participate fully in a dynamic, collaborative network of investigators committed to improving pediatric health outcomes for rural children across the country.",

Approximately 50% of women have\ndense breasts, which increases their risk 3-5 fold compared to those with entirely fatty breasts, but only a subset\nof them will develop breast cancer. One explanation lies in tumor microenvironment (TME) changes that promote\na breast tumorigenic environment. The organization of stromal and glandular breast tissue subtypes plays a\ncrucial role in influencing tumor invasion dynamics. However, there has been limited research on mammographic\nsubtypes of dense tissue and their potential links to risk. In the original R15 funding period the PI and his team\nshowed that they can segregate mammographic dense tissue into two textural subtypes: active dense tissue,\nwhich is structurally reorganizing and links to cancer dynamics, versus passive dense tissue. More recently, they\nfound that tissue restructuring associated with early tumor onset may be detectable via computational\nmammography prior to radiological diagnosis. The original R15 grant helped show that the amounts and temporal\nchange of mammographic dense tissue subtypes may influence cancer risk. In this renewal, a novel and powerful\ncomputational technique is proposed to complement the textural analysis for mammogram and also for histology\nwhole slide imaging both proximal and distal to the tumor and for several tumor subtypes. The proposed research\nwill advance the education and career preparation of undergraduates within Maine\u2019s only biomedical engineering\nprogram, nurture a growing partnership among the University of Maine, Spectrum Healthcare Partners and\nMaine Medical Research Institute, introduce two UMaine faculty to biomedical research, and support the early\ncareer development of two assistant professors.",

Knowledge of the intensity, frequency, distribution, and genetic\nregulation of these elemental evolutionary processes is therefore essential for understanding the evolutionary\norigins of disease-associated variation and predicting the evolutionary fate of genomes. This research program\nwill unlock new basic biological understanding into the evolutionary mechanisms that give rise to genomic\nvariation, with a particular focus on repeat-rich genomic loci. Our work will draw on the strengths of the mouse\nmodel system, including its translational relevance to humans, genetically diverse inbred and outbred strain\nresources, large whole genome sequence datasets from pedigreed populations, tools for functional discovery,\nand museum-archived samples for wild-caught mice. The proposed program is organized into three major\nresearch areas. The first research focus will pursue in-depth investigations of repeat-rich functional chromatin\ndomains responsible for chromosome segregation, genome stability, and fertility. Using state-of-the-art long-\nread sequencing methods, we will generate high-quality de novo assemblies for diverse inbred mouse strains\nand pursue focused comparative genomic studies of two highly repetitive genomic loci: the Y chromosome and\ncentromeres. We will complement these genomic investigations with hypothesis-driven studies to assess the\nfunctional consequences of diversity at these loci for male fertility and the fidelity of chromosome segregation,\nrespectively. Second, we will retroactively mine laboratory mouse reference mapping populations as controlled\nevolution experiments. By monitoring the flow of genetic information over multiple generations, we aim to\ncharacterize variation in germline mutation rates, map mutation rate modifiers, and identify phenotypic correlates\nof mutation rate heterogeneity. Third, we will lead the development and analysis of a large-scale whole genome\nsequence resource comprised of ~1000 wild mouse genomes. Recognizing that deleterious variants are\nmaintained at low frequency in the wild by the action of natural selection, we will identify variants in inbred mouse\nstrains that are individually rare in wild mouse populations, and use allele frequencies in wild mice as a criterion\nfor prioritizing likely deleterious causal alleles within legacy mouse QTL mapping datasets. Together, these\ninvestigations will make substantial inroads to our understanding of the mechanisms of genome diversity at\nstructurally complex functional chromatin domains and the genetic and environmental controls on mutation rate.\nIn addition, this program will create a new genome sequence resource that will empower biomedical and basic\ndiscovery in the mouse model system and solidify the PI\u2019s leadership in the mouse genomics community.\nCrucially, the proposed program will also create meaningful hands-on research training opportunities in\npopulation and evolutionary genomics, computational biology, and mouse genetics at the undergraduate,\npostbaccalaureate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.",

These vascular\ncontributions encompass issues that include small vessel disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and\nblood-brain barrier dysfunction. Conventionally, dementia resulting from vascular problems was labeled as\nvascular dementia, while AD was linked to neurodegeneration due to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\nHowever, recent data indicate that these conditions form a spectrum which includes mixed etiology dementias,\nwhere multiple brain pathologies coexist. Efforts to elucidate and understand the causal changes that underlie\nthe vascular contributions to cognitive decline and dementia are being advanced by the use of genetic and\nbiomarker studies in humans and model organisms, aided by implementation of new multi-omic technologies.\nHowever, despite the growing importance and relevance of this area of biomedical research, there is currently a\nlack of specialized conferences that address this topic and that provide a forum for sharing of advances and\nchallenges \u2013 in particular one focused on training the next generation of scientists.

These research efforts have produced significant insight into biology and disease, and yet there are many opportunities to accelerate innovation, development, and early dissemination of genomic technologies. The goal of the Technology Development Coordinating Center (TDCC) is to maximize these opportunities by promoting interaction among grantees, supporting innovative new ideas through pilot funding, and aiding in the dissemination of research results and new technologies to the broader scientific community. The TDCC will focus on three primary areas, aligned with these goals: 1) Support information exchange across the GTP leading to cross-fertilization of ideas. We will build on established Scientific Working Groups (SWG) that provide a venue for discussion of work in progress and collaboration on areas of shared interested and by hosting the annual program meeting Advances in Genomic Technology Development (AGTD). We will also work with the Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS) each year to host the annual CEGS program meeting, providing logistical support and programmatic continuity, while encouraging evolution of the format based on the location and host priorities. We will use the SWGs to identify gaps in the field that will provide the foundation for solicitation of Opportunity Funds. 2) Establish and manage an Opportunity Funds program to support initial development of promising new technologies and ideas or to enhance dissemination of new technologies. Peer review will be conducted by an External Review Panel of experts representing the breadth of fields of the GTP. 3) Implement outreach activities to improve awareness of GTP successes and facilitate access to GTP research by the broader scientific community. Outreach activities will be a combination of online/webinar format, focused video productions, and in-person meetings that incorporate interactive components. We will incorporate input on content and format from other NIH programs. A concerted effort will be made to promote TDCC outreach activities to a broad group of researchers who may benefit from information about new technologies from the GTP and their applications. The annual and SWG meetings will provide opportunities for trainee engagement and contribution. Leveraging the experience of the large number of SBIR award recipients who are TDCC participants, we will focus on issues related to commercialization of new technologies providing researchers with information and perspective on how to expand access to new methods beyond the developers\u2019 labs. The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) is well qualified to serve as the TDCC, bringing together broad expertise in genomics, extensive experience in consortium management and conference development, and established relationships with NHGRI grantees.",

In addition, Dr. Agoro outlined a career development roadmap in building skills in bioinformatics during\nthe K99 phase with a vision of leveraging novel technologies to understand the pathogenesis of CKD as an\nindependent investigator. Dr. Agoro proposes four career goals during the K99/training phase: 1) To master the\nscATACseq analytic pipelines; 2) To generate conditional mouse models; 3) To successfully find a faculty\nposition and 4) To develop leadership and professional skills in communication. Further Dr. Agoro will undergo\ntraining activities that include didactic and experiential learning to enable him to gain the necessary skills for\ngenomic data analyses. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Agoro and his primary mentor, Dr. White, PhD, have\nassembled a strong team formed with a co-mentor, collaborators, advisor, and consultant to assist Dr. Agoro\nthrough the proposed training, research activities, and faculty job search. The proposed career development\nplan will utilize the intellectual and bioinformatics resources at IUSM. In addition, Dr. Agoro will attend national\nmeetings, as well as seminars/courses and workshops locally. Research: CKD is an important public health\nepidemic affecting approximately 37 million Americans. CKD disease progression is associated with a graded\nincrease in oxidative stress driving highly adverse complications. This proposal will decipher novel pathways\ninvolved in renal stress control via the following specific aims: Aim 1 will identify the mechanisms by which\nKlotho-dependent FGF23 signaling regulates HMOX1. In Aim 2, Dr. Agoro will test the role of Klotho and Hmox1\nin CKD pathogenesis with a specific focus on renal oxidative stress, iron metabolism and mitochondria function.\nSummary: The proposed research will profile the genome-wide chromatin accessibility of renal proximal tubule\nin Klotho-transgenic vs WT mice and study the effects of Klotho-dependent FGF23 signaling on Nrf2 binding to\nARE elements. Dr. Agoro will also determine the role of the FGF23-Klotho-Hmox1 axis on renal oxidative stress\nduring CKD.

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nInbred mouse strains are integral tools for both preclinical and basic research. While the absence of genetic\ndiversity is a widely perceived strength of inbred strains, it is also a critical limitation, as a single inbred genetic\nbackground cannot capture the full spectrum of phenotypic responses observed in genetically diverse human\npopulations. This limits the translation success from inbred mouse models to human clinical outcomes and\nunderscores the need for mouse platforms that more accurately model human genetic variation. The Diversity\nOutbred (DO) mouse population was founded in 2012 to meet these crucial research needs. The DO was initiated\nfrom eight genetically diverse inbred mouse strains, including wild-derived representatives from each of three\ncardinal house mouse subspecies, and has been maintained by pseudo-random mating for over 50 generations.\nHowever, the inclusion of founder strains derived from reproductively isolated subspecies has, over time,\nexposed genetic incompatibilities and unchecked selfish elements, resulting in allele frequency distortions that\nhave compromised the genetic integrity of the DO. Here, we propose to generate a new, high diversity outbred\nmouse population, the Wild Mouse Diversity Panel (WMDP), founded from novel wild-derived inbred strains of\nsingle subspecies origin (Mus musculus domesticus). Our recent work has shown that a large proportion of\nvariants in the genomes of these newly developed M. m. domesticus strains are absent from existing inbred\nmouse strains, and that these strains capture novel neurobehavioral, metabolic, physiological, and biochemical\nphenotypes not observed in common laboratory mouse models. Thus, the WMDP stands to minimize potential\nhaplotype distortion due to genetic incompatibilities between subspecies, allow functional assessment of millions\nof variants that have never been tested in the laboratory, and empower investigations of natural genome\ncomplexity. In Aim 1, we will initiate an outbred population from four phenotypically and genetically diverse wild-\nderived M. m. domesticus inbred strains, implementing routine genomic monitoring of allele frequencies to\nensure the genetic integrity and longevity of the WMDP resource. To aid discovery efforts in this new population,\nwe will generate key genomic resources for the founder strains in Aim 2, including high quality de novo genome\nassemblies, comprehensive variant call sets, and a gene expression atlas of several tissues. In Aim 3, we will\nprovide a proof-of-principle study to underscore the power and utility of the WMDP. We will profile phenotypic\ndiversity for several morphological, metabolic, behavioral, and clinical traits in early outbreeding generations of\nthe WMDP, map causal loci, and integrate our findings with human data to identify human-mouse translational\nparallels at the levels of both genes and gene networks. This project will yield a new outbred mouse population\npoised for near limitless discovery in all areas of basic and preclinical research. This resource will become part\nof the Special Mouse Strain Resource at The Jackson Laboratory, which will provide the framework and setting\nfor its long-term maintenance and distribution to the global research community.",

The project draws upon scholarship in four distinct academic fields. First, environmental history,\nwhich demonstrates how microbes, animals, and other forces of nature act upon history by reinforcing or\nlimiting human agency. Second, the history of medicine, which connects race, gender, and class to\nreconsider how illnesses and identities entwine.

It is a story of diabetes as\nmaterial reality, of its increase and spread over the course of the twentieth century. It is a story of the\ncreation of knowledge about diabetes to aid diagnosis, promote prevention, and assist treatment from\nclinical findings to entire populations. And it is a story of diabetes as a cultural symbol for ideas and\npractices about health, human behavior, and the environment that often generate inequalities. Sweet\nBlood blends these stories to reframe diabetes as a series of environmental relationships that change over\ntime and space.

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe characterization of the full spectrum of genetic variation from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data is\nessential for genome research and precision medicine. Recent technological advances have led to substantially\nimproved sensitivity in detecting and characterizing structural variants (SVs) and the generation of highly\ncontiguous phased genomes; however, some genomic regions (e.g., short arms of acrocentric chromosomes,\npericentromeric regions and regions containing complex SVs) remain extremely difficult to accurately assemble\nand genotype. The Investigators of this project are well qualified to tackle this problem. They have worked\ntogether for well over a decade to make substantial advances toward comprehensive SV discovery and improved\ngenome assemblies by combining data from multiple technologies and developing new tools for analyzing and\nintegrating these data.\nThis competing renewal for a community resource has four aims. In Aim 1, computational methods will be\ndeveloped to optimize SV discovery through accurate genome assembly - in the absence of parental sequencing\ndata - and will be applied to 426 samples from all 26 diverse populations of the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP)\nwhere long-read sequencing data are available from both the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium\n(HGSVC) and Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) efforts. Aim 2 will develop pipelines that will\nprovide the most comprehensive, rapid and low-cost genotyping of SVs in short-read datasets. This will be made\npossible from the incorporation of pooled Strand-seq data and inversions in 1000 individuals from the 1kGP. Aim\n3 will develop pipelines and resources for SV imputation, genotyping, and functional characterization that can\nbe used for future association studies. Proof-of-principle studies will be conducted on the 1kGP, and an autism\nspectrum disorder (ASD) cohort. Aim 4 will develop a fine-resolution SV resource containing precise breakpoint\ninformation and biologically relevant annotations. New visualization and analytical tools will be built into the\nInternational Genome Sample Resource (IGSR), making the data and tools acquired from this project widely\navailable and in a manner that preserves the complexities of SVs. As a part of Aim 4, we also outline a plan to\nprovide dedicated user training for our tools and datasets in different geographical locations and multiple times\na year to maximize research community awareness and adoption. Taken together, our community resource\nproject will provide valuable methods and tools for benchmarking SV discovery and genotyping across WGS\ndatasets in the human genomic research and clinical domains.",

Beyond\nincreased scientific challenges (such as data integration and harmonization), so too do the challenges to\ncoordinate, communicate, and collaborate effectively within the Program increase. The proposed project includes\nfour major research projects, supported by three resource cores, executed by a diverse multi-disciplinary team\ndistributed across five research institutions. The goal of this Administrative (Admin) Core is to facilitate their\ncoordination, communication, and collaboration. Our leadership team has extensive experience coordinating and\nmanaging large, multi-investigator programs; most notably as a small animal testing center in Somatic Cell\nGenome Editing (SCGE) Phase I funding, and as a precision genetics center (JAX Center for Precision Genetics,\nJCPG) improving animal models of human disease and move them towards translation to the clinic. In each of\nthese programs, we have established frameworks for organizing our teams, sharing information across projects\nand institutions, tracking progress and milestones, and communicating progress to key stakeholders as well as\nthe NIH program officers. Our previous experience leading Administration/Coordination Cores for multi-\ninstitutional, NIH-funded Programs makes us uniquely qualified to develop and execute on the administrative\ngoals of this U19. The Admin Core will provide managerial and administrative structure for this U19 Program\nthrough the following Aims. In Aim 1 we establish an effective administrative governance structure to assure\nsuccess of this U19 Program. We use prior experience and Program-specific characteristics to build a clear\nhierarchy of governance and include guidance from clinical experts in neurodegenerative diseases to hasten\nIND application. In Aim 2 we develop a formal meeting schedule to foster the communication needed to execute\non the goals of this proposal. The Admin Core will be responsible for managing this schedule, recording, and\nreporting out on the progress and action items identified in these meetings. The Admin Core will use these\nreports to monitor progress toward milestones of the Program and each Project for Aim 3, assisting NIH Program\nofficials in their alignment of our Program with SCGE Phase II. Finally, the Admin Core will communicate the\nfindings from this U19 Program with the Translational Coordination and Dissemination Center for external\ndistribution and assist in the creation of a shared learning and training education hub.",

Interventions are tested in parallel at three\nsites (The Jackson Laboratory, University of Michigan, and University of Texas) using identical standardized\nprotocols. Such treatments include pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, foods, dietary supplements, plant extracts,\nhormones, peptides, amino acids, chelators, redox agents, and other compounds or mixtures of compounds. We\npropose to advance the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD) in response to emerging needs of the aging research\ncommunity, specifically the ITP, to continue being a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) that curates ITP data,\nmakes it available through a public database, and provides tools that enable users to visualize, analyze, and\ndownload the primary and summary data from these studies. Our objectives are to provide a central repository\nfor data, documentation, and protocols, offering a unique and important venue for ITP investigators needing to\nmake their data public; to continually refine and develop tools and features to best locate, present, and analyze\nthose datasets; and to maintain, enhance, and promote this resource to further enable quantitative, standardized\nand predictive phenotype studies and, in turn facilitate new scientific advances in the field of aging. We have\ndesigned a publicly accessible website and data repository for the ITP. We have also curated and posted data\nfrom numerous ITP studies. ITP plans for the next five years include additional lifespan trials, detailed analyses\nof agents found to increase lifespan, and continued growth in data on health outcomes. To help support these\ngoals, our specific aims are to: 1) maintain information on experimental designs, protocols, and SOPs, 2) create,\nmaintain, and update a publicly accessible electronic inventory of samples in the Interventions Biospecimens\nRepository (IBR), 3) coordinate data collection among the three ITP Centers and members of the research\ncommunity conducting focused, ancillary studies on specific interventions, 4) provide a statistical core for\nindependent analysis of data collected by ITP, 5) implement interactive and dynamic visualization tools for\nstatistical analyses and data reuse, and 6) maintain a public-access interactive website and machine accessible\ndata repository for ITP. Successful completion of our Aims will yield a widely useful and sustainable system for\npublic access to experimental details and analysis of ITP data. The resource will have a modern interactive\nenvironment and expose the data for many applications that support replication, extension, and interpretation of\nITP studies in the context of lifespan, health span, and disease biology research. This will help maximize the\nvalue of these data and provide the traceability and reproducibility required for extension and translation of the\noutcomes of ITP testing.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nArsenic exposure from well water and food is a major public health concern. Early life (e.g., prenatal) exposure\nto low level arsenic increases risk of developing psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety in\nadulthood. Arsenic is an endocrine disruptor and available evidence suggests that its psychopathological effects\nstem from interference with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling; however, gaps remain in our understanding\nof the underlying mechanisms. Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 9 (Klf9) is a transcription factor important for neurogenesis\nand metabolic regulation and is a regulatory hub at the junction of multiple endocrine and cellular stress signaling\npathways. KLF9 has been implicated in stress-induced psychopathology and neurodegeneration. We and others\nhave shown that Klf9 is a feedforward regulator of GR signaling. We have obtained preliminary data indicating\nthat the GR-Klf9 gene regulatory pathway is perturbed in zebrafish embryos exposed to low-level arsenic, This\nexploratory/developmental research project will use zebrafish as a model system to test the hypothesis that\nchronic early life exposure to low levels of arsenic increases risk of depression and/or other psychiatric disorders\nby developmentally altering homeostatic setpoints to persistently impede GR- and/or Klf9-dependent stress\nresponsivity, resulting in long-term loss of plasticity and dysfunction. Zebrafish are an ideal model system for the\nproposed studies as they share all the relevant genes and neuroendocrine signaling pathways with humans, and\nare social, diurnal animals with complex behaviors that can be measured and related to human psychology and\nstress-responsive behavior. Moreover, the larvae provide unsurpassed access for experimental manipulation\nand observation, and transgenic reporter lines for monitoring GR and brain activity by fluorescence microscopy.\nThe proposed research will use those tools, as well as a klf9 and GR-knockout lines that we recently created\nusing CRISPR, to accomplish two specific aims. The first is to determine if chronic exposure to arsenic results\nin long-term glucocorticoid resistance and increased neuroinflammation. To that end we will assess the effects\nof chronic arsenic exposure during early development on basal and stress-induced activity of GR target genes\nand inflammation markers in larvae and adult brain tissue, as well as on larval and adult cortisol levels. The\nsecond specific aim is to determine if chronic developmental exposure to low level arsenic results in aberrant\nbrain activity and behaviors. To accomplish this, we will use fluorescence microscopy and automated movement\ntracking to ask how chronic developmental exposure to low-level arsenic affect brain development, basal and\nstress-responsive neuronal activity in parts of the larval brain that regulate neuroendocrine stress signaling, and\nbehavior of the exposed larvae across the lifespan. The project will open a new avenue for future research\nfocused on the mechanisms underlying the the pathophysiological effects of early life arsenic exposure on the\nneuroendocrine stress system.",

We\nhave incorporated known senescence inducers (e.g. Doxorubicin, Palbociclib, high fat diet) in the mouse model\nand shared relevant tissues (lung, muscle, ovary) with other SenNet TMCs for analysis. In the parent grant to\nthis supplement, we have established The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Cellular Senescence Network Tissue\nMapping Center (JAX-Sen TMC) focused on the analysis of mouse tissue to address a significant research and\nclinical need for improved biomarkers and cellular maps of senescence. Advances in our understanding of\nbiological aging and the recognition of aging as a modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases and geriatric\nsyndromes are fueling a growing interest in the cellular underpinnings of the aging process. Despite recent\nprogress in cellular senescence research and the discovery of new senolytics and senomorphics, we lack clear\ninformation regarding the role of cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease, and the effect of genetic\nvariation on these phenomena. In the JAX-Sen TMC we are mapping senescent cells in the context of multiple\nage-matched tissues of genetically defined mouse cohorts, raised in standardized environments throughout their\nlifespan and defining senescent cell phenotypes associated to features of genetics, age and senolytic\ninterventions. The tissues of specific focus within the JAX-Sen TMC are kidney, pancreas, heart, and placenta.\nThis supplement aims to generate detailed tissue mapping data on the mouse pancreas and kidney derived from\nour senescence inducers study and perform the analysis of this data using our existing framework. Specifically,\nwe will employ bulk RNA-seq, H&E, CODEX multiplexed antibody imaging, and Xenium in situ RNA spatial\nprofiling. Senescent cells identified from the senescent inducers experiment will be directly compared to those\nfrom natural aging, and provide the foundation for future senolytic/senomorphic functional studies.",

JAX-Sen is organized around three cores nested in the well-resourced\nenvironment for aging research and multi-omics profiling at JAX. JAX-Sen will profile senescent cells in kidney,\nadipose tissue, placenta, pancreas, heart, and hypothalamus, selected for their clinical relevance to chronic\ndiseases of aging, the domain expertise of the JAX-Sen leadership team in the biology of these tissues, and the\noverlap of four of the tissues with KAPP-Sen. We will leverage cutting-edge mouse resources including the\nDiversity Outbred, which offers unparalleled genetic diversity for modelling a range of molecular senescence\nphenotypes, and new inbred (C57BL/6J) transgenic mice that express p16 and p21 driven fluorescent tags to\nallow visualization enrichment for specific senescent cell subsets. The Biological Analysis Core will apply a\nmultitude of analytical modalities to selected tissues (bulk and single cell and single nucleus RNAseq, Visium\nspatial transcriptomics, multiplexed antibody-based imaging, multiplexFISH, imaging mass spectrometry\nincluding lipidomics, metabolomics, proteomics, 3D tissue reconstruction from serial sections), and will re-\nevaluate these technologies throughout the project period to ensure our approaches align with those of other\ncenters and that we maximally benefit from the technology development efforts in SenNet. These profiling\nactivities will yield subcellular resolution of biomolecular content in senescent cells not possible with human\nsamples, along with an expanded set of senescent cell biomarkers. The Data Analysis Core will combine robust\ncomputational capability with scalable and reproducible scientific workflows to develop and implement Network-\nwide open data and metadata standards. The Data Analysis Core will benefit from JAX\u2019s unique mouse research\nresources to establish the diversity of senescence by integrating with expression quantitative trait locus and\nprotein quantitative trait locus data in DO mice and JAX bioinformatics resources, e.g., Mouse Genome\nInformatics, Mouse Phenome Database, Monarch Initiative. The integrative mining of JAX-Sen data will lead to\nnovel methods for multi-modal 3D map reconstruction from imaging data and will yield an important resource for\nSenNet interpretation and enrichment of human senescent cell data. Finally, the Administrative Core will provide\nstrong oversight of project progress and nurture a culture of collaborative, dynamic scientific exchange within\nJAX-Sen. It will also maximize JAX-Sen\u2019s engagement in the consortium through collaborative activities that will\nhelp optimize data generation activities and create new research synergies. In so doing, JAX-Sen will help\nachieve the goal of SenNet to generate a unprecedented atlas of mouse senescent cells and new biomarkers of\nsenescence for human analysis and therapeutic application.",

Biological aging\u2014in contrast to chronological\naging\u2014occurs at different rates for different individuals. In humans, growing old comes with increased health\nissues and mortality rates, yet some individuals live long and healthy lives, and others succumb earlier to\ndiseases and disorders. The concept of frailty is used to quantify this heterogeneity and is de\ufb01ned as the state\nof increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. The frailty index (FI) is an invaluable and widely used tool\nwhich outperforms other methods to quantify frailty. FIs have been adapted for use in mice using a variety of\nboth behavioral and physiological measures as index items. However, because conducting mouse FI requires\ntrained individuals for manual scoring, it often limits the scalability of the tool. Thus, although the FI is an\nextremely useful tool for aging research, an increase in its scalability, reliability, and reproducibility through\nautomation would enhance its utility. We used machine learning applied to video data to create an automated\nvisual FI (vFI). The is easy to implement, unbiased, and scalable. Here we propose to improve our tool and carry\nout an interventional study. We will adopt the vFI to function with genetically diverse mice (R61: Aim 1). We will\nalso create features from long-term monitoring to increase accuracy and breadth of systems measured in the\nvFI (R61: Aim 2). Finally, we will apply the vFI to a diet intervention study to show its utility for large scale studies\n(R33: Aim 3). We will test a high fat high sugar diet (increased frailty) and caloric restriction group (decreased\nfrailty) with normal chow (control) in a Diversity Outbred population of mice. The result of this project will be a\nfully validated and automated vFI that can be used for high-throughput interventional studies, enabling\ntherapeutics for healthy aging.",

JAX MorPhiC will comprise, under one roof, a team of highly collaborative scientists with\ncomplementary skill sets and decades of cumulative experience in mammalian gene knockouts (KO), stem cell\nand developmental biology, molecular phenotyping, single cell analysis, and advanced metabolomics and\nlipidomics capabilities.

Our rationale for selecting these lineages is that they are two of the most evolutionary divergent\nbetween species, and primate-specificity is one of our criteria for gene prioritization. In addition, the extra-\nembryonic lineage rapidly develops into a cellular functional endpoint responsible for many biological processes,\nthus permitting interpretation of function of diverse genes, whereas the early neuroectodermal lineage is relevant\nto neurodevelopmental disorders. In Aim 1, we will prioritize genes for knockout; selection criteria include\nexpression in extra-embryonic or neuroectodermal lineages, primate-specific features, broad classes of\nfunctions while enriching for transcription factors, and genes implicated in human disease.

We will engineer KO clones for 250 genes in the well-characterized, stable human\niPSC line, KOLF2.1, while considering the effects of sex, genetic background, possible adaptive/compensatory\nresponses, and different KO strategies including incorporation of conditional/reversible and scalable approaches.\nIn Aim 3, will carry out comprehensive phenotyping of derivatives differentiated from KO iPSCs. We have\nselected a combination of assays to maximally integrate consistency, scalability, and functional informativeness\nto help achieve the overall objectives of the MorPhiC Consortium. These include imaging, single cell\ntranscriptomics, single nucleus epigenomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics. Our research Aims will be\ncoordinated in administrative Aim 4, which will ensure efficient project management and oversight, internal and\nexternal communications, and data dissemination to the MorPhiC Data Resource and Administrative\nCoordination Center (DRACC). Successful completion of the proposed work will address several main barriers\nhampering the ultimate goal of the MorPhiC Consortium to functionally characterize all human genes: identifying\nthe most effective KO strategies and optimal phenotyping technologies, as well as scaling efficiencies to expand\nthis program towards future MorPhiC Phases. In the process, we will generate a valuable resource of 250 human\niPSC KO lines that will be distributed to the scientific community via existing operational infrastructure at JAX.",

            "project_description": "Project Summary/Abstract\nVision loss is a devastating medical problem that generates significant medical costs, directly as well as\nindirectly in the form of decreased productivity, lower quality of life, and loss of independence among those\naffected. In the United States, disorders of the eye result in a significant economic burden for society. Because\nthe human retina has minimal or no regenerative ability, loss of retinal neurons due to intrinsic defects or\nenvironmental insults is generally irreversible, making this the most common cause of permanent visual\nimpairment. In this project, the candidate proposes to study the development of retinal ganglion cells, the\noutput projection neurons that connect the eye with the brain. These neurons are vulnerable to injury in\ntraumatic optic nerve injuries and to diseases such as glaucoma, and a deeper understanding of their\ndevelopment and regeneration could have significant implications for reversing visual impairment. In the first\npart of this application, the candidate proposes to investigate the function of a transcription factor expressed by\nretinal ganglion cells in a mouse line with this gene conditionally deleted, and by using overexpression in\nretinal progenitor cells in vivo. In the second part of this application, the candidate proposes to screen a\ncandidate list of transcription factors by overexpression in vivo for their ability to reprogram endogenous retinal\ncells to produce new retinal ganglion cells. Overall, insights from the study of normal retinal ganglion cell\ndevelopment will be applied to develop methods for replacing these cells when they are damaged or diseased.\nThe candidate\u2019s overall career goal is to understand developmental processes that shape the nervous system,\nand to apply this developmental knowledge to regenerate neurons lost to injury or disease. The candidate has\na deep background in cerebral cortical developmental biology and proposes to receive training in retinal\ndevelopment because the retina is significantly more accessible to clinical manipulation, and promising\nregenerative therapies are already beginning to come to fruition. During the mentored phase of this award, the\ncandidate will prioritize undertaking activities to increase understanding of retinal development, to do\nproductive and meaningful science, and consequently to transition research from cerebral cortical development\nto retinal development. The PI will work with mentors Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg and Dr. Sui Wang, together with\nmembers of a Stanford faculty advisory team. The proposed research and training plans will take place in the\nlaboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at Stanford University School of\nMedicine. The outstanding vision science group at Stanford is embedded within the world-class neuroscience\nand broader life sciences community at Stanford as a whole, with benefits of a close-knit and focused\ndepartment and the resources of the wider university.",

By applying agent combinations against patient-derived\nmodels, it is possible to obtain evidence to determine the most promising combinations for advancement to\nclinical testing in defined sub-populations of cancer patients. However, integration of PDX drug response with\nmolecular characterization data across diverse PDX collections is needed to enable this vision. A key aspect is\nthe need for well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of standardized datasets\nfrom PDXs and other patient-derived models. The Jackson Laboratory-Seven Bridges (JAX-SB) PDX Data\nCommons and Coordination Center (PDCCC) has addressed this challenge for the last 5 years, uniting the\nefforts of the data-generating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI\u2019s\nPatient-Derived Model Repository/PDMR) components of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research\nNetwork (PDXNet) into a cohesive, trans-Network whole.

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAge is one of the most clearly defined risk factors for cancer. As the incidence of cancer increases with age,\nrising more rapidly beginning in mid-life (ages 45-64 years), cancer can be considered an age-related disease.\nRecent studies have identified age-dependent somatic mutations, including alleles with a role in cancer initiation,\nin a spectrum of human tissues. In the hematopoietic system this is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and is\nmost commonly caused by mutations in the epigenetic regulators DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 within the\nhematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment. How the aging process promotes clonal selection,\nexpansion, and transformation from CH to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poorly understood. The long-term\ngoal of this research is to understand the mechanisms by which aging promotes transformation causing\nhematologic malignancies. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which\nincreased inflammation observed during aging promotes expansion of CH-mutant HSPCs, and the extent to\nwhich this fitness advantage is provided by altered epigenetic regulation occurring as a direct consequence of\nCH mutations. Preliminary data show that CH-mutant HSPCs have a more potent selective advantage and\nundergo more rapid malignant transformation in aged compared to young mice. Mechanistically, increased\ninflammation in aged mice is a driver of this phenotype and epigenetic alterations are found to accumulate in\nCH-mutant HSPCs with aging. These data support the central hypothesis that aging-associated inflammation is\na selective pressure favoring CH-mutant HSPC expansion and malignant transformation, and that clonal\nexpansion, epigenetic alterations, and risk of transformation caused by CH mutations are dependent upon\nsustained CH-mutant allele expression. This project will use cellular and molecular biological approaches in aged\nmice integrated with studies using primary human CH samples to achieve the following specific aims: AIM 1.\nDetermine the extent to which clonal hematopoietic expansion and leukemic transformation in the aging context\nis due to inflammation; and AIM 2. Determine the mechanisms by which, and extent to which, reversion of a CH\nmutation during aging alters clonal evolution and risk of leukemia initiation. The proposed research is\nconceptually innovative because it is the first to determine how inflammation and epigenetic dysregulation\nconspire during the aging process to expand, evolve and transform CH-mutant clones. The proposed research\nis technically innovative as it incorporates novel co-culture systems and therapeutic studies to assess key\ninflammatory drivers, as well as a novel murine model with CH-mutant induction and reversion capabilities to\ninvestigate CH mutant allele dependencies in clonal expansion, epigenetic alterations, and leukemic\ntransformation. This study is significant because understanding the mechanisms by which aging contributes to\nclonal expansion and transformation will provide insights into effective therapeutic strategies targeting clonal\nevolution, attenuate pathophysiology promoted by clonal expansion, and intercept malignant transformation.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nOur overarching goal is to discover the genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying behavioral predisposition\nand development of addiction. Addiction remains a substantial worldwide social and economic burden despite\nextensive efforts to curb drug availability and use. The high heritability of cocaine addiction, indicates that the\npropensity to develop a substance use disorder (SUD) after drug exposure is genetically influenced. Both\nhuman and animal studies indicate that behavioral traits such as novelty seeking are strongly correlated with\nthe propensity to develop an SUD, but the biological basis of this relationship is unknown. We identify and\ncharacterize biological mechanisms of addiction and predisposing behavior by harnessing advances in mouse\ngenetic resources, including the high-precision Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population, validation in\ngenetically modified mice, gene expression quantitation through RNA sequence analysis, and computational\nand statistical methods in systems genetics. In Aim 1 we will identify genetic mechanisms underlying\npredisposing novelty-related traits and drug self-administration through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in\na large set of DO mice. The most compelling and tractable of these will be validated in gene targeted mouse\nmodels. The intravenous drug-self administration (IVSA) paradigm, considered the gold standard for the\nassessment of addiction traits in rodent research, will enable quantification of the core features of addiction\nincluding initiation of drug use, poor extinction and enhanced reinstatement of reinforced drug taking. In Aim 2\nwe will quantify gene expression genetic variation in two connected addiction relevant tissues, the prefrontal\ncortex and striatum, map expression QTLs and identify genetic correlates of predisposing behavior using RNA-\nseq in a drug-na\u00efve subset of DO mice, and disseminate these results through widely used informatics\nresources. Gene expression analysis in drug-na\u00efve mice enables separation of the biological substrates of\npredisposition to addiction from the biological sequelae of drug exposure. In Aim 3, we will address the\nfundamental problem of evaluating coordinated gene expression across multiple components of the addiction\ncircuitry to assess relative dysregulation toward the identification of global- vs brain region-specific factors in\naddiction vulnerability. This will be accomplished through the development of robust multivariate statistical\nmethods for identification of relations across multiple high dimensional data sets. This strategy will make\ncontinued use of a common collection of phenotypes to relate disparate and incompatible measures across\ntwo independent sets of mice, while extending into multiple tissue co-expression networks. Development of this\ntechnique in the context of addiction research will extend a unifying data integration framework to\nmultidimensional to human and mouse genetic and genomic studies for all disease areas. Synergy among the\naims will reveal networks from polymorphism to addiction-related behavior.",

            "project_description": "Project Summary\n The pluripotent potential of a cell is generally assumed to be a product of its nucleus, regulated by gene\nexpression and chromatin state. This view informs most approaches to drug discovery, where an ideal\ntherapeutic would target nuclear processes to induce pluripotency and proliferation to heal a wound or inhibit\npluripotency and proliferation in cancer. Often overlooked are somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments that\ndefinitively show cellular potential is also a product of the cytoplasm, specifically, the cytoplasm of germ cells.\nThe long-term objectives of this research are to understand how cellular pluripotency and regenerative capacity\nare retained in germ cells through their specialized cytoplasm. We expect these findings to inform and expand\napproaches to drug discovery and lead to therapeutics that function by targeting the cytoplasmic milieu.\n Cytoplasmic processes unique to germ cells often occur in protein/RNA assemblies that reside on or near\nthe nuclear periphery. These assemblies are collectively called germ granules. Because core germ-granule\ncomposition is conserved from nematodes to humans, we can use C. elegans nematodes to visualize germ\ngranules in vivo and to expedite studies into their function. Mutations that displace or severely disrupt germ\ngranules in C. elegans cause sterility and germline-to-somatic reprogramming. In this proposal, we look at the\nearliest events of somatic reprogramming to determine how processes within germ granules antagonize this fate.\nWe investigate the contribution of glycine-rich repeat motifs to the specialized germ-granule microenvironment.\nWe then describe two novel interactions with a core germ-granule protein called GLH-1 (DDX4 in humans). One\nof these interactions with GLH-1 likely facilitates the hand-off of mRNAs from germ granules to initiate translation.\nThe other is a dynamic interaction with GLH-1 that activates a conserved cellular pathway to trigger engulfment\nby surrounding soma. Lastly, we follow up on another core germ-granule protein that we named LOTR-1\n(TDRD5/7 in humans) and its LOTUS-domain-dependent interaction with a 3\u2019UTR binding complex. Together,\nthese findings will provide an understanding of cytoplasmic processes within germ granules that ensure the\npluripotent potential of germ cells.",

            "project_description": "Project Summary\nAlthough there has been decades of assis\u019fve technology (AT) development, naviga\u019fon\u2010related challenges remain one of\nthe most signi\ufb01cant obstacles to independence and overall quality of life for blind and visually impaired (BVI) people. The\nstar\u019fng point for this research is the view that most naviga\u019fon challenges experienced by BVI travelers are not due to\nvision loss but caused by insu\ufb03cient informa\u019fon provided by current naviga\u019fon technologies. Naviga\u019fon is a con\u019fnuous\nendeavor involving route planning, way\ufb01nding, environmental interpreta\u019fon and monitoring, and real\u2010\u019fme movement,\nbut exis\u019fng AT solu\u019fons address these aspects in a fragmented way that signi\ufb01cantly limits e\ufb00ec\u019fve spa\u019fal learning and\nnaviga\u019fon. This fragmented approach focuses on isolated tasks (pre\u2010journey learning vs. in\u2010situ naviga\u019fon), segregated\ninforma\u019fon (routes vs. maps), speci\ufb01c modali\u019fes (language vs. hap\u019fc), and siloed technology development (digital apps\nvs. physical tac\u019fle maps). This two\u2010phase R61/R33 project aims to break down silos characterizing decades\u2010long AT\ndevelopment by developing an integrated mul\u019fsensory naviga\u019fon solu\u019fon, called Mul\u019fNav, which converges pre\u2010journey\nmap learning with in\u2010situ naviga\u019fon assistance, wrapped in a learnable and usable smartphone applica\u019fon with strong\npathways to transla\u019fon. To do so, Mul\u019fNav advances the state of the art for mul\u019fsensory access iden\u019f\ufb01ca\u019fon through\ndevelopment of the \ufb01rst user\u2010centered design guidelines specifying the key informa\u019fon/modality (I/M) pairings needed\nto support the highest probability naviga\u019fon tasks across the complete trip. U\u019flizing these I/M pairings, the Mul\u019fNav app's\nmul\u019fsensory mapping system provides users with route and environmental overviews for use in both pre\u2010journey\nexplora\u019fon and during real\u2010\u019fme travel, enabling BVI people to obtain a level of environmental access, naviga\u019fonal\nassistance, and spa\u019fal learning capabili\u019fes that are simply not possible from current naviga\u019fon AT solu\u019fons. A signi\ufb01cant\ninnova\u019fon of Mul\u019fNav's approach is that route guidance and map overview informa\u019fon are coupled with a unique\nexplora\u019fon modes that enables BVI users to learn the real\u2010world environmental features necessary for safe street crossing\n(e.g., intersec\u019fon geometry, presence of medians, loca\u019fons of accessible pedestrian signals), as well as a tra\ufb03c view mode\nthat provides mul\u019fsensory \u019fme\u2010of\u2010day tra\ufb03c data to enable users to hear and feel how a crossing will be navigated in\nadvance. These features are introduced to users in a gami\ufb01ed learning mode such that the user interface can be learned,\nunderstood, and u\u019flized long\u2010term via engaging naviga\u019fon scenarios. As a result, Mul\u019fNav's user\u2010driven inclusive design\napproach is expected to solve high\u2010probability naviga\u019fon challenges with tractable and measurable outcomes that will\nsigni\ufb01cantly improve BVI mobility, independence, and overall quality of life as a sustainable pla\u019eorm with widespread\nadop\u019fon.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overarching goal of my laboratory is to determine how natural genetic variation influences\nchromatin biology, cell fate, and, ultimately, phenotypic diversity. Since most disease-associated variants\noccur in regulatory elements rather than coding genes, delineating the role of regulatory variation in normal health\nand disease is a critical pursuit of modern genomics. Further, when variants disrupt gene regulation early in\ndevelopment, it can lead to lasting defects in the structure and function of adult tissues. Regulatory element\nfunction is determined by, and can be identified through, combinatorial sets of post-translational modifications\non chromatin. To understand how genetic variation impacts chromatin modification and function and results in\nchanges in development, we exploit the rich resources in mammalian diversity by deploying a novel cellular\nsystems genetics approach using stem cells to model cell fate and differentiation. In the past 5 years, we\nestablished this innovative platform and developed a productive program to study how genetic variability in the\nepigenome shapes chromatin organization, subsequent gene expression, and cell identity. Specifically, we\ndefined extensive trans-regulation of the pluripotent genome and identified genetically determined differentiation\npropensity. The Baker lab is continuing to harness these collective strategies and build on these findings to\naddress the following gaps in our knowledge: What are the molecules and mechanisms underlying regulation of\nthe chromatin landscape? How does genetic variation influence chromatin structure and function? How does\nvariation in the establishment of the chromatin landscape impact differentiation and development? In the current\nproposal, we will determine how the trans-regulation of chromatin impacts developmental disorders and answer\noutstanding questions in the exaptation of transposable elements. We will develop tools to screen chromatin\nregulators for their modification of developmental disorders and transposable element regulation. We will also\ndetermine how genetic variation impacts expanded stem cell populations that contribute to extra-embryonic\ntissue, improving the fidelity and reproducibility of ex vivo models of development. Together, this research\nprogram will continue to shed light on the fundamental regulatory processes that shape genome function by\ncombining discovery-based approaches through cellular systems genetics and hypothesis-driven mechanistic\nstudies, which will be critical to fully realize the potential of regenerative medicine.",

The majority of mutations\nare dominant missense mutations that cluster in the conserved motor domain of the protein and lead to a\nspectrum of neurological phenotypes beginning in childhood, including muscle weakness, microcephaly,\nperipheral neuropathy, intellectual disability, autism, optic nerve and cerebellar atrophy. Without treatment,\nchildren and adults affected by KAND suffer from the progressive loss of their mobility, vision and even early\ndeath due to intractable epilepsy and complications of respiratory illness. Mouse models are a critical component\nto both understanding disease mechanisms and to serve as a key platform for preclinical testing of novel\ntherapeutics. Unfortunately, mouse models to advance our understanding of KAND biology and therapeutics are\nseverely lacking, although very much in reach.\nThis proposal aims to build on our current knowledge of KAND to design mouse models that will not only provide\npatient avatars for KAND disease pathophysiology but will also serve to address important questions around the\ntiming of therapeutic rescue, effects of overexpression, what cell types are required for effective treatment and\nhow much genetic correction is required for disease modulation. Importantly, the models will be valuable for pre-\nclinical testing of therapeutics. The work described in this proposal leverages recently published Natural History\nStudies by our clinical collaborator, Dr. Wendy Chung, which provides ongoing insight into the clinical features,\nprevalence and biomarkers associated with this patient community. Our overall goals are to provide the scientific\ncommunity with well designed, rigorously tested mouse models that recapitulate key aspects of KAND disease\nmanifestations to be used, without restriction, throughout academia and industry for research and therapeutic\ndiscovery.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAlthough chemotherapy has significantly improved the survival of breast cancer patients, treatment failure still\nremains a major clinical issue worldwide. Current knowledge about treatment failure is mostly derived from\nresearch on intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance in epithelial tumor cells. However, recent studies have\nimplicated a critical role for host cells (i.e., the tissue microenvironment) in building a protective \u201cniche\u201d for\ntumor cells enabling their escape from chemotherapeutic treatments. Notably, the host regenerative response\nupon chemotherapy \u201cinjury\u201d, which is regarded as a host intrinsic mechanism to repair damaged tissues, may\nbe exploited by tumor cells for their local recurrence or distant metastases. The proposed study will build on\nour extensive experience in the study of tumor-stroma interactions in breast cancer metastasis, and will\ninvestigate the poorly explored question of how chemotherapy-induced changes in the lung stroma foster the\nearly relapse of tumor cells in the lung. Based on our previous findings that tissue resident mesenchymal stem\ncells (MSCs) acquire a significantly higher potential to promote local tumor growth upon cancer therapies, we\nhypothesize that systemic chemotherapy treatment stimulates regenerative responses in lung resident MSCs,\nwhich are, in turn, utilized by drug-resistant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) for their metastatic relapse in the\nlung. By designing different chemotherapy treatment scenarios in animal models mimicking clinical situations\nin human breast cancer patients, we will in Aim 1 determine how chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and\ndoxorubicin modulate the lung resident MSCs using our newly established endogenous MSC modeling\nplatform in mice. Subsequently, we will in Aim 2 delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-activated\nlung resident MSCs to support metastatic tumor growth in the lung, with a focus on the TLR4 signaling\npathway and the key wound healing cytokine osteopontin (OPN). Finally, we will in Aim 3 define the\ntranslational potential of stroma targeting approaches using both patient-derived xenograft models and breast\ncancer patient specimen analyses. We will specifically focus on the therapeutic efficacy of combining\nchemotherapy with TLR4 or OPN blockage in treatment of patient-derived human basal-like xenograft breast\ntumors. Further, by analyzing clinical plasma samples from human breast cancer patients, we expect to\ndevelop plasma OPN as a biomarker to predict early metastatic relapse of breast cancer patients after\nchemotherapy. Overall, our proposed study will energize an underdeveloped field of research that investigates\nthe impact of cancer therapeutics on the pre-metastatic microenvironment. Findings from the proposed study\nwill facilitate the development of clinically applicable strategies to improve treatment efficacy and prevent\nmetastatic relapse of breast cancer by interfering with the tissue metastatic microenvironment.",

My parental R37 focuses\non examining how fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) impact multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable blood\ncancer that results from mutations that accumulate in the plasma cell. Myeloma cells grow in the rich soil of the\nbone marrow (BM), first very slowly, and then more quickly and aggressively, causing degradation of the bone\nand development of drug resistant clones. Although therapies exist, novel approaches to myeloma therapy are\nneeded. Our prior work suggested that myeloma cells can become drug resistant and proliferate faster through\nsupport from proteins called fatty acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FABP4 and FABP5). In Specific Aim 1 of our\nparent award, we are analyzing how BM adipocytes and the FABPs contribute to myeloma by using novel,\nthree-dimensional (3D), tissue engineered cancer models as well as FABP inhibition methods. In Specific Aim\n2, we use mouse models to study the roles of the FABP members in MM, as well as the roles of BM\nadipocytes. The long-term goal of our work is to understand molecules and mechanisms driving MM growth;\nthis Extension and Parent project specifically will identify new mediators driving MM and propose paradigm-\nshifting concepts to guide the development of new anti-MM therapies. The proposed studies in this Extension\nbuild on our prior and ongoing work in the Parent award, and add complementary data and translational\nsignificance to the findings. Both Extension Aims will be used to identify translationally significant effects and\nmechanisms of FABP actions on tumor cells and on the tumor immune microenvironment. Our Extension\nSpecific Aim 1 is to Create FABP5 and FABP6 knockdown (KD) MM cells and phenotype these cells in\nvitro & in vivo. Our Extension Specific 2 is to Investigate the effects of obesity on MM growth and drug\nresistance, and the roles of FABPs in this process using FABP inhibitors and Fabp4/5dKO in vivo\nmodels. This Extension will explore the roles of the FABPs in MM cell growth, survival, and drug resistance in\nvitro and in vivo using oral administration of the FABP inhibitor BMS309403 and using a FABP4/5dKO (double\nhomozygous knockout) mouse model. Analyses of tumor and non-tumor BM microenvironment cells, as well\nas mouse serum, blood, and other tissues are intended to illuminate the actions of FABP inhibition not only on\ntumor cells, but also on surrounding cells and the mouse overall. This work in thoroughly understanding the\npotential roles and mechanisms of action for the FABPs in MM is essential in moving towards clinical use.",

OAG risk increases with age and presents not only an increasing economic burden on health care\nsystems, but also a challenge in ensuring fair and equitable treatment approaches. Unfortunately, poor\nunderstanding of OAG risk factors has constrained currently approved treatments to intraocular pressure\n(IOP) reduction. Other factors such as vascular health, specifically blood pressure (BP), are known to alter\nrisk of OAG onset and progression. BP and IOP vary by person, with both high and low BP being\nassociated with the disease process. Thus, quantifying the relative contribution of BP as a risk factor in\ncombination with IOP for a given individual inclusive of other demographic disparity factors will produce a\ntranslational framework to advance glaucoma management.\nThe main goal of this project is to develop an innovative method for interpreting weighted contributions of\nIOP and BP, along with other risk factors such as age, gender and race. A significant outcome of this\nresearch will be a framework to assist clinicians in directing care to those who need it the most while\npreventing unnecessary treatments for those at lowest risk. The proposed method consists in: (i)\ndeveloping a fast and accurate emulator for estimating the physiological status of a person's eye based\non individual-specific values of BP and IOP (Smart Eye Emulator, SEE; Aim 1); (ii) developing a method\nfor Transfer Learning of patient clusters across diverse and heterogeneous datasets that leverages the\nphysiological-enhanced variables provided by SEE (physiology-enhanced data analytics; Aim 2); and (iii)\nensuring relevance of the project outcomes by incorporating dynamically the feedback of end-users on the\nperceived usability and usefulness of the proposed approach in clinical practice (Aim 3).

Mounting\nevidence suggests CPC is bioavailable, retained in tissue, toxic to eukaryotes at low doses, and present in\nhumans. Mitochondrial dysfunction/deformation lead to neurological, immunological, and other diseases. We\ndiscovered that exposure-relevant, non-cytotoxic CPC doses potently perturb mitochondria (ATP, morphology,\noxygen consumption) and cause Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria, but the mechanisms remain unknown. This\nproject will determine the underlying mechanisms and outcomes of CPC mitochondrial toxicity and, critically,\nwill promulgate new general mechanisms of mitotoxicity. Our preliminary data show CPC impedes multiple\nelectron transport chain (ETC) components. CPC also suppresses immune cell signaling via interference with\nphosphorylation, Ca2+ dynamics, and protein binding to key signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-\nbisphosphate (PIP2). Preliminary data reveal CPC disruption of PIP2 diffusion and cluster properties at the\nplasma membrane. PIP2 is also found at the outer mitochondrial membrane and its disruption leads to\nmitochondrial fission--though understanding of PIP2\u2019s mitochondrial biology is in its infancy. We hypothesize\nthat CPC interferes with PIP2, phosphorylation, Ca2+, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and\nspecific ETC Complexes/associated lipids and enzymes, thus disorganizing mitochondrial shape and function.\nUsing immune (mast and T cells) and barrier (skin, oral, GI) cells, we will assess CPC effects on the ETC using\nelectron flow, qPCR, Western blotting (WB), and measures of mtROS and cardiolipin. ETC disruption\noutcomes (ATP, glycolysis, lactic acid) will be determined. Kinetics of TCA enzymes in the presence of CPC\nwill be assessed. Super-resolution fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy will interrogate\nnanoscale CPC effects on mitochondrial morphology and PIP2 clusters and protein interactions at\nmitochondria, revealing the fundamental biology of this critical signaling lipid at the mitochondrion. Confocal\nimaging will provide another perspective, including mitochondrial translocation in the cell. We will assay CPC\neffects on mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins with qPCR, confocal of subcellular dynamics, and WB, including\nof phosphorylation status. We will determine the mechanism by which CPC affects the AMPK/mTOR pathway,\nwhich leads to mitochondrial fission, by assessing phosphorylation status with WB. We will extend the findings\nwith a proven animal model for mitochondrial research, C. elegans, assessing CPC effects on mitochondrial\nstress responses, mitochondrial membrane potential, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This research will\nuncover the mechanisms underlying CPC disruption of mitochondrial function in order to fulfill an urgent need\nby providing insights into CPC effects on environmental human health.

Collectively these support\nmetabolic homeostasis and barrier function of the retina.\nMany RPE disease phenotypes are shared between humans and mouse models carrying mutations in cell-\nadhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Defining causative pathways and networks that are induced\nby mutations or pathogenic variants may provide therapeutic targets. Identifying druggable targets that act during\nthe pre-symptomatic stage of the disease is particularly important to enable development of therapies that can\nprevent, delay onset, or decrease the severity of RPE-associated diseases, irrespective of the initial cause of\nthe disease, before the pathologic changes become irreversible.\n The goal of this application is to identify shared pre-clinical and end-stage phenotypic and cellular effects of\nmutations in two genes, Ctnna1 and Lratd2, which are highly expressed in the RPE and lead to similar retinal\ndefects. Mutations in CTNNA1 have been reported in patients with Pattern Dystrophy and Lebers Congenital\nAmaurosis (LCA), and LRATD2 has been associated with early AMD in a genome wide association study. Our\napproach is to use clinical, functional and biochemical tests to provide a deep characterization of the models and\nto analyze associated cellular changes using single-nuclear transcriptomics as well as spatial\nmetabolomic/proteomic measurements. These phenotypic and genomics data will be jointly analyzed using\ncomputational methods to identify the shared pathways perturbed in these models. Our use of two models with\nshared pathologies will let us filter out mutation specific alterations and focus on the shared disease-causing\npathways. Using our mouse resources, we also plan to enhance current models.\n Successful completion of our studies will identify novel pathogenic pathways underlying RPE-related\ndisorders, revealing potential therapeutic targets that could be effective in a broad range of these diseases,\nregardless of the cause of the disease.

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSocial isolation is a potent form of psychosocial stress, and a growing public health concern. Older adults,\nparticularly those individuals isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic, are particularly vulnerable. One in four\nindividuals over the age of 65 are estimated to be affected by social isolation and loneliness, which are\nassociated with an increase in mortality risk by up to 70%. Previous studies have shown other forms of\npsychosocial stress and mental illness are associated with increased risk for osteoporosis and related\nfractures, which are likewise associated with increased mortality in older adults. Despite the increase in social\nisolation and the overlap between at-risk populations, there has been little research on the effects of social\nisolation on bone loss and skeletal metabolism. The limited work that has been done in rodents suggest that\nsocial isolation negatively impacts bone health, leading to decreased bone mineral density. None of these\nstudies, however, have explored the mechanisms of isolation-induced bone loss, or examined differences in\nthe effect of isolation on bone between the sexes. My own preliminary studies show that males exposed to\nsocial isolation had reduced femoral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and cortical thickness.\nFemales, conversely, did not have any reduction in bone mass. My data also showed changes to\nglucocorticoid receptor and \u03b22 adrenergic receptor expression as a result of social isolation, which both have\nknown effects on bone. The goal of this project is therefore to test the overarching hypothesis that social\nisolation leads to bone loss through altered glucocorticoid (Aim 1) and sympathetic nervous system (Aim 2)\nactivity. I will test these hypotheses using a 4 to 8-week-long mouse model of social isolation in 16-week old\nmice, in combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches. I will also use proteomic and microRNA\nsequencing approaches to identify novel systemic changes in response to social isolation that may impact\nbone. The proposed project will be the first study to identify mediating mechanisms of social isolation-induced\nbone loss and precisely test the effects of isolation on bone metabolism through a range of imaging, genetic,\nhistologic, and omic approaches. The results of this project will inform future clinical and epidemiological\nstudies, and help identify prevention strategies and treatments for individuals at the greatest risk for social\nisolation.",

            "project_description": "Endocrine diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and thyroid conditions exhibit relatively\u00a0high heritability according\u00a0to epidemiological\u00a0and familial studies, but genetic mutations identified\u00a0to date can only explain a very small proportion of clinical cases. This gap raises the possibility that abnormal epigenetic information, elicited by environmental circumstances and transmitted between generations, significantly contribute to the missing heritability of these conditions. In this regard, thyroid abnormalities are very prevalent in humans, but studies defining the consequences for endocrine pathophysiology in the children and descendants of affected individuals are sorely lacking. Based on preliminary observations on\u00a0a mouse model of developmental thyrotoxicosis due to functional loss of the type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) and subsequent impairment in thyroid hormone clearance, we hypothesize that developmental paternal thyrotoxicosis causes in the offspring a broad and complex syndrome affecting the regulation of energy balance and multiple endocrine systems of relevance to obesity and type 2 diabetes, including including the thyroid axis, the leptin-melanocortin system and insulin-glucose homeostasis. Preliminary data indicate that this syndrome, which we termed \"SOFT\" for \"Syndrome Of Father's Thyrotoxicosis\", exhibits sexually dimorphic severity, and features obesity, aberrant insulin-glucose homeostasis, altered physiological responses to fasting a a high fat diet, and abnormalities in molecular markers of the thyroid axis, and leptin-melanocortin and ghrelin systems.\u00a0 The aims of the project will further characterize SOFT, establish its molecular and physiological basis, and define how it is paternally trasnmitted and generated in the offspring. Aim 1 will determine the role of neonatal leptin in the generation of SOFT. We will test whether the blunted peak of neonatal leptin exihibited by the offspring of thyrotoxic fathers is responsible for the abnormal endocrine programming characteristic of adult mice with SOFT. Aim 2 will determine the role of paternal Thra in the generation of SOFT. We will test whether the establishment of an altered germ line epigenome in thyrotoxic fathers and the developmental abnormalities and generation of SOFT in their offspring requires the mediation of the alpah sioform of the thyroid hormone receptor. We anticipate our work will generate a novel paradigm for the non-genetic but heritable etiology and susceptibility to endocrine conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and thyroid disease. This heritability would be dependent on a paternal history of abnormal thyroid hormone status, a highly pevalent occurrence in humans not only in adult life, but also during fetal development due to maternal thyroid disease. Our research will uncover new mechanisms underlying the heritability of these endocrine conditions. Our results will support comparable translational studies in humans that will ultimately provide novel epigenetic tools and markers for the close monitoring, effective prevention and advisable treatment of endocrine pathologies.",

The NIA\nInterventions Testing Program (ITP) evaluates drugs proposed to extend mouse lifespan by retardation of\naging or postponement of late life diseases. Interventions proposed by multiple collaborating scientists from the\nresearch community are tested, in parallel, at three sites (The Jackson Laboratory, University of Michigan and\nUniversity of Texas), using very similar, standardized protocols, and using enough genetically heterogeneous\nmice to provide 80% power for detecting changes in lifespan of 10%, for either sex, after pooling data from any\ntwo of the test sites. One hundred and two such lifespan experiments, involving various doses of 66 distinct\nagents, have been initiated in the first twenty years of the ITP. Thirty-six experiments have involved\ncomparative tests of multiple doses of effective agents, variable starting ages, or alternative dosing schedules.\nStatistically significant effects on longevity, in one or both sexes, have been documented and then confirmed\nfor NDGA, rapamycin, acarbose, 17-\u03b1-estradiol (17aE2), and canagliflozin. Significant effects were also noted\nfor Protandim, glycine, meclizine, captopril, and astaxanthin. Lifespan trials are now underway for 25 new\nagents. ITP survival results have also documented longevity benefits from four agents started in middle-age:\nrapamycin, acarbose, 17aE2, and canagliflozin. A Collaborative Interactions Program (CIP) has provided\ntissues from ITP drug-treated mice to an open, growing, international network of scientific collaborators,\nmeeting 26 requests from 17 distinct laboratories in the previous five-year period. Plans for the next five-year\nperiod include additional lifespan (\"Stage 1\") studies, detailed studies (\"Stage 2\") of drugs found to increase\nlifespan, transition from the CIP to an Interventions Biospecimens Repository, additional diagnostic specificity\nin pathological assessments, inclusion of RNA-Seq data in all Stage 2 studies, and comprehensive\npharmacokinetic assessments of drugs found to increase lifespan, as well as continued collaborative work with\na network of scientists to study drug effects on postulated aging mechanisms and links to disease. Site-specific\nstudies at The Jackson Laboratory will add a tests for heart, kidney, and bladder function in Stage 2 studies,\nand image analysis of tissues using machine learning. The work proposed should allow the ITP to continue to\nmake major contributions to mammalian aging biology.",

Iron deficiency, which can lead to\nanemia, represents a major component of the global disease burden worldwide, especially in women. Iron\ndeficiency-related anemia affects >1.2 billion individuals worldwide, and iron deficiency without anemia is even\nmore frequent. Understanding the basic molecular mechanisms underlying specific iron disorders is critical to\ndesigning future therapeutic strategies. Approaches using iron supplementation or iron chelators are employed\nglobally to improve iron metabolism. However, their effectiveness can vary among patients due to the diverse\nmechanisms underlying iron disorders. Some etiologies are linked to impaired iron absorption in the intestine,\nwhile others involve issues with iron delivery to the bone marrow, which is crucial for sustaining erythropoiesis.\nThe goal of my program at The Jackson Laboratory is to identify the root causes of iron disorders, including iron\ndeficiency, iron deficiency anemia, anemia, and/or iron overload, by holistically investigating the fundamental\nbiological mechanisms of iron metabolism. By focusing on the etiology of these disorders rather than merely\naddressing the symptoms, we aim to facilitate personalized medicine tailored to each patient\u2019s specific needs.\nDuring the next five years, the AgoroLab will develop a novel computational framework, the Multi-Omics-Multi-\nOrgan sequencing (MOMO-seq), for studying mammalian iron systems biology in different tissues associated\nwith iron metabolism phenotypes and identify key organs, cells, and molecular features that drive iron disorders.\nMOMO-seq couples the power of single-cell multi-omics technology to profile DNA accessibility with\ntranscriptomics/histopathology approaches to study iron biology across multiorgan systems, enabling the\nidentification of cell-specific mechanisms and inter-organ communication circuits associated with iron\nmetabolism. Within our framework, we will be able to shed light on some of the key yet unanswered questions\nin iron biology. This includes deconvoluting the complex multiorgan signaling network that maintains iron\nhomeostasis. For instance, how does the bone marrow communicate with the spleen to meet the high iron\ndemand of erythropoiesis? How do kidneys regulate iron reabsorption? Developing MOMO-seq will be pivotal in\nestablishing and strengthening my independent research program, as well as laying the groundwork for an\ninnovative, comprehensive approach to studying iron metabolism and its implications in health and disease.",

Maine is the most rural state in the United States and two-\nthirds of hospitals have low birth rates of less than one newborn per day. This low birth rate precludes clinical\nteams from having regular opportunities to maintain essential neonatal resuscitation skills. Strategies to\nimprove and maintain neonatal resuscitation skills at rural hospitals are urgently needed and essential to\npreserve maternal and infant care at critical access hospitals. In situ simulation training has been shown to be\nan effective training tool, allowing delivery room teams to deliberately practice resuscitation skills on a\nmannequin in their native clinical setting with experts present to provide guidance and lead a team debriefing\nfollowing the training session. This training allows rural clinicians to practice essential resuscitation skills\nincluding adherence to the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines, teamwork and communication\nthrough scenarios created to intentionally replicate critical clinical situations. Clinicians then receive directed\nfeedback in debriefing sessions following the simulation training to review their performance and assess for\nareas of improvement.\nThough effective, in situ simulation training in rural hospitals is dependent upon the availability of experts and\nis cost prohibitive due to the expensive simulation equipment. Telesimulation is an alternative method of\nproviding simulation training and employs many of the principles of in situ simulation training, with remote\nparticipation from experts for observation and debrief support. In a pilot study, we demonstrated that regular\nmonthly telesimulation training for 12 months at one rural hospital led to substantial improvements in\nadherence to NRP, teamwork and communication scores. In the proposed randomized non-inferiority cluster\ntrial, we will compare two types of telesimulation technology and employ implementation science to ensure\nconsistency in the approach across different institutions as well as develop a framework to enable\nimplementation at other sites. Specifically, we will test an innovative mixed reality hologram (HoloBabyTM) that\nour research group has developed and patented against the current high-fidelity standard mannequin\ntelesimulation used in our pilot study. The primary outcome is the performance of the medical teams during a\nresuscitation as measured by a score evaluating adherence to the gold standard NRP guideline.\nCommunication and teamwork will also be assessed as secondary outcomes and using The Mayo High\nPerformance Teamwork Scale. The HoloBabyTM leverages novel technology to provide a less expensive\nalternative to make simulation training more widely accessible to rural community hospitals allowing rural\nclinicians to deliberately practice resuscitation skills, prioritizing learning and competence, without\ncompromising patient safety.",

Communication at apical junctions between hair cells and their glial neighbors,\nthe supporting cells, is particularly important for proper hair cell orientation. While supporting cells are known to\nrelay polarity signals between hair cells, the possible influence of polarity mechanisms on their own differentiation\nis not well-studied. Pillar and Deiter's cells, specific types of supporting cells, have a complex and asymmetrical\nmorphology beneath the epithelial surface. These cells develop apical extensions called phalangeal processes,\nwhich interdigitate between hair cells and play a critical scaffolding role in cochlear amplification and thus auditory\nfunction. The proposed research hypothesizes that mouse Pillar and Deiter's cells acquire their phalangeal\nprocesses through a postnatal polarization program similar to the polarization of hair bundles in hair cells.\nPreliminary results suggest that the basal body of supporting cells is planar-polarized and can exhibit a highly\ndynamic behavior during development. We aim to track the position of the basal body in supporting cells from\nembryogenesis to adulthood, correlate its position with the emergence of dense microtubule arrays in the\nunderlying phalangeal process, and investigate defects in one relevant cell polarity mutant context. Additionally,\nwe aim to develop methods for sparse labeling of supporting cells to track their individual morphology and\nanalyze structural changes during phalangeal process development. Examining the polarization of supporting\ncells offers a novel perspective to address their complex remodeling, a neglected aspect of auditory science\nwhere new approaches and tools have potential for significant discoveries. Beyond providing a better\nfundamental understanding of supporting cell development, this groundwork will enable the analysis of\nmorphometric changes in mutants causing congenital hearing loss. This work also has broader potential for\nstudying supporting cell integrity in various conditions including aging and trauma such as noise damage.",

Spatial transcriptomic approaches are revolutionizing our understanding of cancer\ninitiation, progression, and drug resistance by revealing expression patterns with tissue morphological context.\nHowever, these approaches have not yet been applied to the interdisciplinary biology of aging-driven cancers,\ndespite the likelihood that intratissue and microenvironmental evolution mediate the aging phenotype. Moreover,\nthe majority of current single cell spatial projects are based on 3' short read RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and\ntherefore lack the ability to detect full-length spliced isoforms, which are frequently observed in tumors and are\nknown to impact tumor initiation and treatment response. Work from us and others has revealed widespread\nalterations in alternative RNA splicing in human tumors, including in breast cancer, and that half of all spliced\nisoforms detected in human breast tumors using long-read sequencing (LR-seq) are missed by RNA-seq and\nabsent from reference transcriptomes. In addition, we have causally linked the upregulation of specific splicing\nfactors with breast tumor initiation both in vitro and in vivo and identified age-dependent changes in spliced\nisoforms in cancer-associated genes in mammary epithelial cells. Together, these results suggest that alternative\nsplicing is a critical mechanism underlying tumor initiation with age, and that spatial LR-seq approaches are\nrequired to resolve these mechanisms. However, standardized approaches and resources to measure, quantify,\nand visualize expression of full-length isoforms within tissues are lacking. This gap in infrastructure impedes the\nfield's ability to identify cell populations that express age-dependent isoforms, how such isoforms impact cancer\ninitiation for example through changes in receptor-ligand interactions. To address these infrastructure and\nknowledge gaps, we will first develop approaches to map and analyze full-length RNA isoforms spatially\nwithin tissue sections (R21 phase, Aim 1). These tools, which merge LR-seq and spatial transcriptomics, will\nbe applicable across sample types and will therefore be of broad, sustainable utility to the research community.\nWe will then apply these technologies to generate a spatial map of full-length RNA isoforms in healthy\nbreast tissues and tumors during aging (R33 phase, Aims 2 and 3). Finally, we will develop data sharing\nand visualization tools for spatial isoform expression to enable others to mine our data via a web resource\n(R33 phase, Aim 4).

The\nGli transcription factors are the downstream effectors of the pathway and have been the subject of much research\nas they are associated with a number of craniofacial syndromes (e.g., Grieg cephalopolysyndactyly) and can\nfunction as both transcriptional activators and repressors of the Hh pathway. Gli3 is most stable and abundant\nas a repressor. Despite this, our recent work identified a specific and necessary role for Gli3 activator (Gli3A)\nfunction during normal development of the mandible that requires additional regulatory inputs to convey a robust\nGli3A response. Little is known regarding what is required for Gli3, as a bimodal transcription factor, to function\nas a potent activator during development. To address existing knowledge gaps in how full-length Gli3 is\nconverted into an activator, we engineered a set of endogenously epitope tagged alleles for Gli3. With these\nnovel tools we propose to: (Aim1) determine if/how chromatin accessibility modulates Gli3A function; (Aim2)\ninvestigate the role of co-factors and regulatory grammar in regulating enhancer output; and (Aim3) unbiasedly\nidentify protein interactors of Gli3A within the nucleus. We will focus on craniofacial development, specifically\ndevelopment of the mandible, as a relevant model for testing these principles given the requirement for Gli\nactivity during glossogenesis and mandibular skeletogenesis. This developmental system will allow us to\ndetermine the requirement for chromatin accessibility, exhaustively interrogate the regulatory grammar, and\nidentify the constituents of the Gli3 activator complex. Recent technological advances will enable hypothesis\ntesting through single-cell analysis of chromatin accessibility and transcription profiles from mutants predicted to\nhave pioneering activity. To validate our findings, we will perform in vivo experiments to test enhancer activity\nand apply CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to functionally assess native binding site requirements. Collectively, our\nstudies will shed light on the regulatory principles governing Gli-directed cellular programs that when disrupted\ncan result in range of human disorders ranging from structural birth defects to cancer.

Towards this, we will 1) examine the biochemical interactions of the mutant synthetases and their\ncognate tRNAs, 2) explore why only alpha motor neurons and a subset of sensory neurons are affected by these\nmutations, and 3) test the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the integrated stress response, which is activated by\nthese mutations. Much of this work has been done in mouse models of these diseases, but to extend these\nstudies into a human system, we have engineered GARS/CMT2D mutations into a healthy control iPSC line,\nKOLF2, which we can differentiate into motor neurons in vitro. We have encountered two challenges with this\nexperimental system. First, the motor neurons are still immature in culture. We have assessed this in part by\ntesting the extent to which they turn on eEF1A2 and turn off eEF1A1. This developmental switch occurs in the\nfirst few weeks of life in mice, correlating with the onset of neuropathy in our Gars mice, and we believe it to be\ncentral to the cell-type specificity of tRNA synthetase mutations, since eEF1As directly interact with tRNA\nsynthetases and charged tRNAs. Thus, we need to develop sophisticated hiPSC co-culture systems to generate\nmore mature motor neurons that switch more completely to eEF1A2. Second, inhibiting the integrated stress\nresponse in our mouse models is highly efficacious, but the rapid response to inhibition and neurophysiological\nimprovements suggest this benefit is coming from improved transmission at neuromuscular junctions. However,\nwhether NMJs are perturbed in the human disease is unknown. The best model for testing this before moving\nto patients is an hiPSC-derived nerve-muscle co-culture system where we can establish that motor neuron-\nmuscle connectivity is indeed perturbed and that treatment with integrated stress response inhibitors improves\nfunction. Establishing this would make ISR inhibitors more translational and increase interest in CMT from\ncompanies developing such drugs. These more sophisticate co-culture systems and particularly those for\nevaluating NMJ connectivity, are beyond the current expertise of the Burgess lab. We therefore propose this re-\ntraining supplement request to train Dr. Timothy Hines in these approaches. Dr. Hines is an accomplished senior\npostdoc who will transition to an Associate Research Scientist position at JAX to do this work. We have\nassembled a team of local and external mentors to train Dr. Hines in these methods. With these skills, Dr. Hines\nwill be well-positioned to find an independent position and secure NIH funding in the future.

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a collection of inherited peripheral neuropathies with a cumulative\nincidence of ~1:2500 people. There is no approved treatment for any of the 100 genetic subtypes of CMT,\npresenting a large unmet clinical need. Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2D is caused by dominant mutations in glycyl\ntRNA synthetase (GARS), encoding the enzyme that charges glycine onto its cognate tRNAs during translation.\nOur working model for the disease mechanism is that the mutant enzyme binds its tRNA substrate, but does not\nrelease it to the ribosome, effectively sequestering the substrate. This results in ribosome stalling at glycine\ncodons and activation of the integrated stress response. Support for this mechanism comes from genetic studies\nin Drosophila and mouse models of CMT2D, in which transgenic overexpression of tRNAGlyGCC was able to\neffectively suppress the neuropathy phenotype. In preliminary studies, we have reproduced this result using\nAAV9 to deliver tRNAGly genes to three different CMT2D mouse models. Glycine has four codons (GGC, GGG,\nGGA, and GGU), and therefore four potential anticodons (GCC, CCC, UCC, and ACC respectively, though ACC\nis likely a nonfunctional tRNA). We made four AAV9 vectors expressing each tRNAGly anticodon driven by a\nPolIII U6 promoter. We found that GCC was highly effective, almost completely suppressing the neuropathy\nphenotype even in mice with a severe allele of Gars. Vectors expressing CCC and UCC were intermediate in\nefficacy, and ACC was ineffective (as anticipated). This profile of efficacy correlates with tRNA abundance and\ncodon usage, and suggests we are replacing the sequestered substrates of GARS with the AAVs. In the R61\nphase of this proposal we will optimize the vector payload (Aim 1) and capsid (Aim 2), and in the R33 phase\n(Aim 3), we will use this optimized vector in rigorous preclinical studies in mouse models of CMT2D. In Aim 1\n(R61), we will construct an AAV9 vector that carries all three effective tRNAGly genes (GCC, CCC, UCC) in a\nsingle vector. We will compare this against GCC alone, which was very effective. In Aim 2 (R61), we will\nrecreate the U6-GCC vector in a MACPNS capsid in an attempt to create a vector that is effective with systemic\ndelivery, rather than dosing directly into the nervous system. We will compare the MACPNS-GCC vector to\nAAV9-GCC. In Aim 3 (R33), we will test the optimized vector (GCC or combined tRNAGlys, AAV9 or MACPNS)\nin two mouse models of CMT2D. We will also allow treated mice to age to show the perdurance of the effect,\nand we will examine the effects of treating after the onset of neuropathy. The successful completion of these\naims will show the in vivo efficacy of an optimized gene therapy treatment for CMT2D in preclinical studies in\nmouse models. This will position us for further translational research and IND-enabling studies through\nmechanisms such as the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network for Biologicals.",

            "project_title": "Impact of Age-Related Clonal Hematopoiesis on Alzheimer's Disease",
            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish whether age-related functional changes in peripheral immune cells\ninfluence Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology onset and progression. While immune dysfunction is a hallmark\nof AD pathogenesis, peripheral-central nervous system crosstalk is not completely understood, creating a barrier\nto the development of new therapeutics for prevention or cure. The foundation of proper immune responses is\nthe hematopoietic system's ability to produce well-functioning cells in correct proportions. Hematopoietic stem\ncells (HSCs), which produce all blood cells (including monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, and B cells), accumulate\nsomatic mutations over their long lifetimes. Certain mutations provide a selective advantage that results in an\nincreased expansion of those HSC \u201cclones\u201d and can lead to skewed proportions of and phenotypic changes in\nproduced cell types. The incidence of this phenomenon, termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH), increases with age\nand is associated with higher risk of multiple diseases. Surprisingly, CH has been recently reported to be\nassociated with decreased incidence of AD. To validate this association and propose an actionable mechanism\nfor clinical disease intervention, we need to understand how mutations in peripheral immune cells impact the\netiology and progression of AD. These studies necessitate mammalian models in which CH and AD\nproteinopathy are inducible in the same individual and blood and brain are available for examination prior to\ndisease onset and throughout disease progression. Our research objective is to investigate the impact of Tet2\nCH mutation on the ability of peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the brain and modulate AD pathology. To\nachieve our aims, we will introduce mutated cells into the circulation of well-defined AD mouse models. We will\nassess the effect of aging and proteinopathy development on the extent CH peripheral cell infiltration, identify\nand quantify infiltrating immune cells and their locations within the brain, determine whether circulating CH cells\nare increasingly primed for mobilization, and assess the effect of CH on AD pathology development. Determining\nthat a CH mutation a) increases the immune cell infiltration into the brain, and b) leads to deceased pathology\nwould provide a direct link between CH and AD and may nominate new candidates for therapeutic intervention\nfor AD.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overall objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a deep learning analytical framework to integrate\nhistological traits into systems genetics analysis of complex diseases. Mapping the risk genes for poor health\noutcomes is a major focus of biomedical research, and new approaches to improve genetic mapping power can\nhave a transformative impact on public health. Genetic disease risk manifests through complex interactions\nbetween gene regulation and tissue structure, ultimately influencing organ function. However, quantifying tissue\nstructure for quantitative genetic mapping has not been widely adopted. This is partly because histological\nscoring has traditionally been labor intensive and error prone, and limited to coarse measures (e.g., discrete\ncategories) that are suboptimal for association testing. In contrast, deep neural networks (DNNs) now routinely\nautomate laborious image quantification tasks for histopathology, making them an ideal platform for integrating\nhistology into genetic analysis. Furthermore, unlike human-defined histological scores, DNN readouts enable\nobjective histological trait discovery as a function of genetic, molecular, and physiological variation. In this\nproject, histological features will be rigorously and robustly quantified using DNNs and these data will be\nintegrated into novel multiscale statistical models that will connect genetic, molecular, and histological variation\nto physiological outcomes. In particular, novel methods will be developed to integrate histology into three major\nclasses of systems genetic analysis, i.e., heritable trait inference, causal mediation analysis, and molecular\nquantitative trait locus (mQTL) mapping. These methods will be developed and validated using a data set of\ngenetic, histological, transcriptomic, proteomic, and physiological data from a cohort of Diversity Outbred mice\nused for the study of age-related kidney disease. By using a model system, complex genetic effects and causal\nmediation hypotheses can be directly tested to validate and refine the analytical framework. The specific aims of\nthis proposal include: Aim 1: Identify maximally heritable histological traits through deep learning on paired\ngenotypes and histological images. Aim 2: Genetically map histological mediators of complex physiological traits\nusing deep learning on histological images. Aim 3: Identify causal paths connecting molecular QTLs (mQTLs) to\noutcomes through histological mediators. The outcome of this study will be a validated methodological framework\nfor histological systems genetics that is modular, enabling a wide range of users to incorporate appropriate\ncomputer vision tools into state-of-the-art systems genetics workflows for any complex disease.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nDeafness is a significant health concern that affects more than 450 million people worldwide, and both\nenvironmental insults and genetic mutations are contributing factors. The auditory organ in the inner ear is\ncomposed of sensory hair cells that detect and transmit sound vibrations. Hair cells are innervated by bipolar\nspiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) that relay auditory signals from the hair cells to the brainstem. Damage causing\nSGN degeneration or affecting SGN projections or synapses with hair cells leads to hearing loss. Mitochondrial\ndysfunction is a common cause of pathologies targeting organs that require large amounts of energy to perform\noptimally, such as neurons. Nuclear DNA mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins can affect\nmitochondrial biogenesis or energy metabolism pathway, affecting auditory function in either case. A focus of this\nstudy, variants in the mitochondrial ACO2 protein have been associated with optic nerve atrophy, seizures, and\nhearing loss in young children. ACO2 is a nuclear gene that produces aconitase hydratase 2, an early enzyme\nin the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Unfortunately, cellular or mechanistic insight into ACO2-related conditions is\nlacking in part due to the absence of adequate animal models. We identified a spontaneous recessive R56L\namino acid substitution in the mouse Aco2 gene based on circling behavior. Homozygotes are viable but show\nearly-onset progressive hearing loss at 1 month of age followed by severe SGN loss at 2 months. I propose that\nthe ACO2 R56L protein variant results in SGN apoptosis due to mitochondrial dysfunction, explaining early-onset\nhearing loss. Aim 1 of this proposal will track SGN defects in the Aco2 R56L mutants from developmental stages\nto young adults. Aim 2 will investigate how the R56L mutation affects the dose and localization of the ACO2\nprotein, and establish how SGN mitochondria number and distribution is altered in time in mutants. Aim 3 will\nattempt to rescue mitochondrial defects and loss of SGNs in mutants via metabolic supplementation. This will\nfirst be tested in organ culture prior to exploiting these results in live mice to improve auditory function. The\nproposed research has the potential to help develop realistic treatments to prevent or rescue hearing loss in\nACO2 patients. Moreover, the new Aco2 R56L mouse strain will be invaluable to model other neurological\ndisorders in ACO2 patients, including optic atrophy.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nMetastatic disease remains the major cause of cancer-related death. Among the vital organs to which solid\ntumors metastasize, the lung is one of the most common. Lung metastases frequently occur in various late\nstage solid cancers including breast cancer. In the past 20 years, significant advances in lung metastasis\nresearch have revealed intricate interactions between the disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and the lung\nmicroenvironment that are essential for the development of metastatic lung lesions. In particular, formation of\nthe immunosuppressive lung pre-metastatic microenvironment (niche), which is driven by factors secreted by\nprimary tumors, is regarded as a key preparation stage prior to the arrival of DTCs. The focus of this proposal\nwill be on the lung resident mesenchymal cells (MCs), an under-characterized stromal cell population within\nthe lung pre-metastatic niche. Preliminary studies in mouse models of breast cancer suggest that lung resident\nMCs serve as a driver of immunosuppressive pre-metastatic niche formation by reprogramming diverse types\nof myeloid cells to become highly immunosuppressive or tolerogenic. The central hypothesis of this proposal is\nthat lung resident MCs drive formation of the lung pre-metastatic niche by endowing diverse infiltrating\nmyeloid cells with an immunosuppressive capacity. To test this hypothesis and uncover mechanisms by\nwhich MCs modulate myeloid cells, we propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Determine the lung resident MC\nchanges in the pre-metastatic niche using genetic manipulation of endogenous MCs in mice. We will\nuse orthotopic breast tumor cell implantation and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) tumor models to\nmeasure the endogenous MC changes at the pre-metastatic stage. MCs will also be ablated in vivo to\ndetermine their necessity for pre-metastatic niche formation. Aim 2: Characterize the key lung\nmesenchymal factors that recruit and modulate myeloid cells. We will use RNA sequencing to profile\ntranscriptome changes between endogenous MCs residing in pre-metastatic vs. normal lungs to identify\nupregulated genes that might play a role in modulating myeloid cells. The contribution of candidate MC genes\nto pre-metastatic niche formation will be evaluated through MC-specific gene knockout. Aim 3: Target lung\nMCs as a strategy for abolishing the immunosuppressive lung pre-metastatic niche in preclinical\nmodels. Using orthotopic tumor implantation models, we will test the ability of lung MC blockade agents to\nboost lung anti-tumor immunity and prevent lung metastasis. These studies will be a significant step toward our\nlong-term goal to fully dissect the roles of organ-specific stromal cells in organ-tropic metastases of breast\ncancer. We anticipate that our findings will establish a strong foundation for the development of novel\ntherapeutic strategies that target stromal factors for the prevention and treatment of lung metastases of breast\ncancer and other solid tumors.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY \nElucidating the mechanism and function of neural encodings and circuit dynamics has been a major challenge in neuroscience and behavioral analyses. However, quantitative behavior analysis has dramatically accelerated and improved with the implementation and application of new machine learning methods, including new deep learning-based methods to track animals at high temporal and spatial resolution. This technology has broad current and potential application that will impact a breadth of fields that have direct relevance and impact on studies of human health and disease, including the fields of neuroscience, behavior, genetics, psychiatry, and biomedicine. However, several roadblocks limit the widespread adoption of these tools and analyses. First, many tracking and behavior analysis packages require a high level of computational expertise and are thus limited in application to expert labs. Second, with high-resolution data streams, quantitating behavior requires new statistical tools and proper modeling of data. Since the application of machine learning to behavioral analyses is an emerging and key methodology, we recognize an unmet need for investigators in a variety of relevant fields to learn the fundamentals of its rigorous use. Thus, to train a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of neuroscience, machine learning, and behavior, we propose to establish an annual 4-day workshop that brings together experts in quantitative behavior, computer vision, and experimental design to provide a practical introduction to the field of quantitative neuroethology and behavior: we propose the unique and timely interdisciplinary course The Short Course on the Application of Machine Learning for Automated Quantification of Behavior at the Jackson Laboratory (JAX). This Short Course will provide attendees (in-person and virtually) with; information on the state-of-the-art of machine learning based behavior quantitation, the fundamentals of behavior quantitation, hands-on workshops and data analysis, a forum for student-teacher interaction for networking, and training at the leading edge of computational ethology. Students will emerge from the course with the ability to: 1) design a high quality, adequately powered behavior experiment; 2) select and install a suitable platform for high-resolution analysis of animal behavior; 3) deploy a behavior data analysis strategy, including collecting new training datasets, training analysis software, and validating performance on held-out data; and 4) run workflows/pipelines that are necessary to analyze their data following extraction. To achieve this, we propose: Aim 1. To develop and deliver a 4-day workshop to train scientists on application of machine learning to animal behavior quantitation. Aim 2. To create an environment that will expand the field of quantitative behavior analysis by fostering idea generation, discussion, and collaboration to yield new discoveries, broader applications, and advance technology development. Aim 3. Foster the recruitment and development of junior investigators in neuroscience, behavioral genetics, and quantitative analysis of animal behavior.",

            "project_description": "Prapela proposes to complete the development of and then establish the safety, efficacy, and clinical risk/benefit of a novel hospital incubator pad that will provide a complementary treatment and the first improvement in the clinical management of apnea of prematurity (AOP) in over 20 years. Defined as cessation of breathing for 20 seconds or longer or a shorter pause accompanied by hypoxemia, AOP is a major morbidity among preterm infants and a significant healthcare burden. AOP affects 70% of all early preterm births (<34 weeks gestational age) and nearly all at \u2264 28 weeks\u2019 gestation. In the United States in 2020, the total annual direct costs associated with AOP exceeded $12 billion. While there is no consensus for treating AOP, common interventions include positional techniques, caffeine citrate, manual tactile stimulation, and supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia. Caffeine citrate is the first line of therapy as it decreases apneic episodes and reduces the need for assisted ventilation. At recommended doses, caffeine has been proven safe and effective. However, in the sole trial supporting its FDA clearance, a majority of newborns treated with caffeine citrate continued to experience apnea events. In 2015, a clinical study using a stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) investigational device reported a 50% reduction in the number of apnea events. Prapela exclusively licensed the SVS technology of the investigational device and has demonstrated technical feasibility replicating the clinically critical stimulation in prototype incubator pads. The broad objective of this SBIR Fast-Track application is to generate the data and documentation necessary for FDA marketing clearance of a novel device to reduce apnea events in preterm newborns. To accomplish this objective, Prapela proposes four Specific Aims: 1) complete development of the SVS incubator pad, 2) demonstrate the safety of the device, 3) determine the clinical efficacy of the SVS incubator pad as an adjunctive therapy to concurrent pharmacological treatment in newborns with AOP, and 4) document the benefit-risk assessment of the device from clinicians caring for AOP patients. Efficacy will be established through a masked, randomized clinical trial with newborns of <33 weeks gestational age, with postmenstrual age (PMA) of <38 weeks at the time of enrollment. The control group will receive standard therapy only with caffeine citrate and respiratory support and an inert SVS device, while the intervention group will receive standard therapy concurrent with the Prapela SVS device. The primary outcome measure will be the mean number of apnea events in the three days after study entry, with a reduction in apnea events of 30% or more considered clinically significant. Questionnaires administered at the end of each experimental period to the clinicians present on the final shift will capture the benefit-risk assessment. The successful completion of the project will provide the data and documentation necessary for FDA marketing clearance and commercialization of our SVS incubator pad as a purpose-built device to improve clinical outcomes of preterm infants with AOP.",

In response to this ongoing need, The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), in\npartnership with Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU), proposes a curriculum development\ninitiative, Genomics in Action, for community college students that will impart content knowledge and skills in\ngenetics and genomics to better prepare them for a variety of careers, such as laboratory, medical and nursing\nassistants. Community college students within the CSCU system are a highly diverse group, with approximately\n50% of students receiving financial assistance and 50% of students from minoritized populations. To achieve\nour objective, we propose the following Aims: 1. Develop 15 virtual modules on key topics in human\ngenomics, tailored to community college student needs. These modules will address curricular gaps as\nidentified through needs analysis with our CSCU faculty. Our innovative approach will utilize short video content\nto introduce topics, demonstrate concepts, as well as provide context for each topic within a career or job in the\ngenomics workforce. Each module will feature a near-peer who is employed in a role for which community college\nstudents are training.

To date, little data exists for more than a quarter of these\ngenes and nearly one third have no functional annotation. Because of the high degree of similarity between the\nmouse and human gene set, genetic data generated in mice can often be extrapolated to human gene function.\nMouse models of genes with common functionality between mice and humans can lead to new models of\ndisease, which are useful for drug screening, preclinical studies, and deeper understanding of biological and\ndisease mechanism. The goal of the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) is to generate lines of\nmice that carry knockouts (KOs) for a genome-wide collection of mouse genes and subject the mice to broad\nbased phenotyping.\nJAX KOMP2 phase 3 proposes to use cutting-edge and cost-effective Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (Cas9 RGN,\nalso called CRISPR/Cas9) technology to generate, breed, cryopreserve and phenotype 600 lines of mice during\nthe project period. Continued effort will be made to improve the Cas9 RGN technology so as to reduce costs,\nincrease targeting efficiency, and create more complex mutant alleles. Genes will be selected in coordination\nwith our KOMP2 and IMPC partners and will focus on those that; have human orthologs, have not been\npreviously knocked out, have no or poor annotation, have significant community demand and integrate with other\nNIH-support programs, or are predicted to function in select pathways. To guarantee ready access to the\ncommunity, we will ship mice to outside investigators while they are alive on the shelf and deposit the lines into\nthe Mouse Mutant Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) repositories for future use.\nBroad based phenotyping on young adult mice up to 17 weeks of age will be performed on all 600 lines of mice\nusing International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)-required and JAX-specific protocols. We will assess\nbody weight and composition, and behavior, cardiovascular, metabolic, ocular and physiological parameters.\nBased on data generated from the current phase of KOMP2, we expect about 30% of lines to be non-viable. We\nwill characterize the non-viable mutants using high-throughput imaging modalities at three embryonic time points.\nBased on previous data we also expect approximately 7% of the lines to be infertile. Direct fertility testing to\nassess the fertility of each sex will be performed on all lines that fail to generate offspring from homozygous by\nhomozygous matings. All data generated from embryonic and adult mice will be rapidly deposited into the Data\nCoordination Center (DCC) that supports KOMP2 and the IMPC.\nLastly, JAX will work collaboratively with the KOMP2 Regional Network and with member organizations of the\nIMPC to share protocols, innovation, and new technology and to broadly and openly disseminate our findings to\nthe international community through publication, presentations at meetings, web activities, and social media.",

Strategies include pooled and individual\ngene knockouts and knockdowns (KDs), generated using CRISPR technologies and auxin-inducible degrons.\nFollowing application of such assays, molecular phenotypes of the cells are profiled longitudinally and at\nindividual time points using bulk and single-cell (sc)RNA-seq.

Our team is uniquely positioned to establish this TF-focused\nDAV: we are co-located with the JAX MorPhiC DPC and have consortium-level collaborations with its PI, while\nour own work focuses on elucidating transcriptional regulation of genes and on developing robust computational\nmethods through community efforts. In Aim 1, we will quantify and control variability in perturbation-based\nregulatory phenotyping by using heterogeneous data generated within MorPhiC to isolate their technical noise\ncharacteristics and to derive a set of TF-gene target pairs (TF-GTs). We will then computationally simulate large-\nscale perturbation screens, through which we will perform power analysis to quantify data variability and make\nrecommendations that ameliorate it. In Aim 2, we will evaluate published gene regulatory network (GRN)\ninference methods. We will also conduct two \u201ccrowd-sourced\u201d DREAM Challenges, in which community\nparticipants will develop GRN inference methods that we will objectively evaluate with MorPhiC data. Using top-\nperforming methods, as well as a novel approach we are developing based on dynamical systems, we will\nperform in silico TF perturbation within the GRNs to prioritize TFs for experimental validation in MorPhiC. In Aim\n3, we will further improve robustness of inferred TF-GTs by integrating them with TF ChIP-seq, HiC, and MPRA\ndata, knockout mouse phenotyping data (KOMP2), and spatial transcriptomics data from JAX and MorPhiC. We\nwill validate published methods for defining tissue-specific GRNs by overlapping them with relevant MorPhiC\nmodel systems and will then use them to predict TF-GTs in systems yet to be profiled by MorPhiC. Our Aims will\nbolster the field's ability to decipher the regulatory function of the ~ 1600 TF genes within the human genome.",

However, there are few options available for their treatment, and\nwithout pathomechanisms being sufficiently elucidated, one's ability to generate a rationale for interventions is\ngreatly limited. Our studies are expected to address this barrier by establishing new etiological factors and\nmolecular mechanisms of mammalian neurodegeneration. One such mechanism is Ribosome-associated\nQuality Control (RQC), that mediates the degradation of incomplete polypeptides produced by ribosomes that\nstall during translation. Key factors working in RQC are the Ltn1/Listerin E3 ubiquitin ligase and its partner,\nNEMF (Rqc2 in yeast). PI Joazeiro has previously found that Ltn1 mutation causes neurodegeneration in mice.\nPI Cox has more recently identified two independent mutations in mouse Nemf causing motor neuron disease\nand used this to knowledge to identify previously undiagnosed patients with a similar neuromuscular condition\nthat inherited causative mutations in the human NEMF gene. In several ways, Ltn1-ENU and Nemf-ENU mice\nphenocopy each other, thus strengthening the connection between RQC dysfunction and neurodegeneration.\nThe proposed studies are aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration\ncaused by NEMF loss of function.

Mechanisms contributing to epileptogenesis are difficult to\nidentify in humans due to genetic and environmental diversity, and as such, preclinical models provide advantages for\nelucidating epileptogenic processes. Our Fos activation pathway and lesion analyses suggest that the ventromedial nucleus\nof the hypothalamus (VMH) is a critical anatomical node for the propagation of seizure discharge from the forebrain\nseizure network to the brainstem seizure network. Our preliminary data further support this hypothesis as loss of\nglutamate transport into presynaptic vesicles by deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter gene, Vglut2, solely in the\nVMH can block seizure propagation into the brainstem seizure network, which contains cardio-respiratory centers. Access\nof seizure discharge into the brainstem results in both brainstem-tonic seizures and increases the probability of Sudden\nUnexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). These data suggest the hypothesis that the VMH is a critical anatomical node\nfor seizure-induced plasticity. It also indicates a VMH neuroanatomical pathway, which may be important in SUDEP,\nsince preventing seizure discharge from propagating into brainstem cardio-respiratory centers could prevent SUDEP. Our\nlong-term goal is to identify neuroanatomical substrates and signaling pathways critical for epileptogenesis, so that\ntherapeutic treatments and preventative strategies can be developed for epilepsy and SUDEP in humans. The overall\nobjectives of this proposal build upon our previous work and preliminary data leading to the following aims/objectives: 1)\nElucidate the mechanisms by which the VMH is involved in the epileptogenic process for allowing ictal discharge\npropagation from the forebrain seizure network into the brainstem seizure network and 2) Determine the genomic\nlandscape in the VMH using spatial transcriptomics before and during epileptogenesis. In Aim 1, we will assess VMH\nreorganizational process using 1) mice with VMH-targeted deletion of genes (i.e., Vglut2, trkB, Bdnf) in our repeated\nflurothyl model to assess seizure outcomes and 2) assess changes in afferent and efferent connectivity to the VMH via\nTimm\u2019s staining (fiber sprouting) and tract tracing. For Aim 2, we will utilize the novel approach of spatial\ntranscriptomics to perform cell-type and regional whole transcriptome analysis using a NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial\nProfiler and Illumina sequencing to determine gene expression changes in different populations of VMH neurons.\nExpression differences will be confirmed by qRT-PCR and/or immunolabeling. Overall, our proposal will elucidate\nseizure response mechanisms that initiate and contribute to epileptogenesis and provide a framework of transcriptional\nnetworks contributing to epileptogenesis that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention for epilepsy and/or SUDEP.",

Diagnosis of genetic diseases is often\nproblematic: roughly 25% of RD patients must wait between 5 and 30 years for a diagnosis, and about half of\nthe initial diagnoses are wrong. For many affected children, definitive diagnosis comes only after a protracted\nand frustrating odyssey of visits to different specialists. Emerging genetic sequencing techniques offer the\npossibility of shortening this long and costly path to diagnosis. Methods for determining the changes in gene\nsequences across all genes (exome sequencing) or all genetic material (genome sequencing), collectively\nreferred to as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and which were first used to identify the genetic cause of a\ndisease in 2010, are now becoming routine in the clinic. The ability to make a diagnosis with NGS has more\nthan doubled since 2010 for children with suspected genetic diseases. The diagnostic analysis of NGS data\ninvolves the assessment of tens of thousands (exome) or even millions (genome) of changes in the DNA\n(variants), which requires sophisticated computer algorithms that can sift through these/this data to find the\ncause. Our group has developed the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), a resource widely used around the\nworld for the computational analysis of clinical data in human genetics and pediatrics, allowing algorithms to\nmatch the symptoms of a patient with database records of over 7,000 genetic diseases.\nOur Exomiser software compares the clinical phenotypes of patients with known human diseases and\ngenetically modified animal models, and couples this with an analysis of the disease-causing potential of DNA\nvariants, greatly reducing the search space to identify the causal variant. Exomiser efficiently processes both\nexome and genome data. In this proposal, we plan to extend Exomiser to utilize new genomic data types\nincluding long-read genome sequencing and NGS-based analysis of RNA data, which will improve\npathogenicity prediction for structural variants (SVs) and for variants affecting gene expression or splicing. We\nwill also predict novel disease genes through characterization of networks of clinical phenotypes and the\nmolecular functions (pathways) of affected genes. We plan to use these algorithms to assess collections\n(cohorts) of unsolved cases in projects such as the 100,000 Genomes Project. Our algorithmic approach will\nbe applied to intelligently reanalyze unsolved cases periodically as new information is added to the medical\nliterature. And finally, we will develop tools to integrate Exomiser into a large range of settings by adding\nsupport for standards generated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). The proposed\nadvances will make Exomiser more efficient, more accurate, and easier for non-specialist pediatricians to use,\nbringing genomic diagnostics to routine pediatric clinical care.",

We have\nidentified the bona fide genetic drivers of these configurations, demonstrated that loss of Trp53 and Brca1 in the\nmouse mammary gland is sufficient to induce tumors with the short-span TDP configuration found in TP53- and\nBRCA1-deficient human cancers, and shown that upon loss of Brca1, TDs are formed through the aberrant\nrepair of stalled replication forks. Here, we propose to deploy a combination of computational analyses, in vivo\nmodelling and in vitro experimentation to achieve a deep mechanistic understanding of how the distinct TDP\ngenomic configurations emerge and impact the course of breast tumorigenesis. Specifically, we will investigate\nthe molecular mechanisms leading to de novo TD formation across the different TDP groups by exploring how\nlocal DNA features associated with DNA replication and fork stalling contribute to the generation of new TDs\nacross a large pan-cancer dataset representing all TDP groups and all TDP genetic drivers (Aim 1A) and how\nloss of BRCA1 activity may modulate the spread and location of the de novo TDs formed in the context of the\nshort-span TDP (Aim 1B). We will establish new genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of breast\ncancer to validate that activation of the Ccne1 pathway or loss of Cdk12 activity, both in conjunction with Trp53\nloss of function, induces medium- and long-span TDP configurations that mimic their human counterparts both\nin terms of TD span size and distribution (Aim 2A) and of the genomic features and genetic elements that are\nassociated with and affected by TD formation (Aim 2B). We will also assess the tumor neo-antigen load of the\nTDP tumors emerging from the newly developed GEMMs and test whether immuno-oncology agents are\neffective against mammary tumors with the TDP configuration, as suggested by recently emerging clinical\nobservations (Aim 2A). We will then use isogenic human cancer cell lines that are either proficient or deficient\nfor BRCA1 activity, to determine the dynamics of de novo TD formation under different modes of cellular\nperturbation and as a function of BRCA1 status (Aim 3A). Finally, we will use the newly developed GEMMs to\nunderstand the evolutionary path to genome-wide TD distribution in the mammary gland, and to discern the\ndynamics of TDP emergence, both in terms of the rate of de novo TD formation and with respect to the timeline\nof breast tumorigenesis (Aim 3B). If successful, this proposal will uncover the root causes of a significant form\nof genomic instability in human cancer, the TDP, define the mutational dynamics leading to cancer formation in\nthis condition, and generate model systems that can lead to the development of new and directed therapeutics\nagainst cancer growth.",

            "project_description": "Obesity and metabolic disease are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, and their increasing prevalence\nhas led to increased rates of vascular pathology in our population. Adipocytes have functional specificity based\non their molecular phenotype; white adipocytes store energy in the form of lipids (white adipose tissue), and\nthermogenic adipocytes burn calories and generate heat (beige and brown adipose tissue). Within the vascular\nmicroenvironment, blood vessels are surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) that impacts vascular\nfunction. In the mouse, PVAT surrounding the thoracic aorta are brown-like, with high levels of thermogenic\nmarkers, and a clear association with vascular reactivity and vascular disease progression. In humans, aortic\nPVAT appears similar to human subcutaneous white adipose tissue, with unilocular adipocytes displaying a\nlipid storage phenotype. However, we identified thermogenic markers within human aortic PVAT, and\nmolecular differences are established between human PVAT from healthy versus diseased vasculature. The\nability to increase the proportion of thermogenic versus white adipose tissue in the body has been suggested\nto be an anti-obesity therapeutic strategy, and increasing thermogenesis of PVAT is predicted to be protective\nagainst vascular disease. Thus, it is critical to understand molecular determinants of adipocyte thermogenesis\nin humans. In collaborative work, we recently defined novel lineages of thermogenic adipocytes that were\nfunctionally tested in mice. These lineages, interestingly, included a smooth muscle cell (SMC) like adipocyte\nlineage, which is relevant to PVAT, which is directly adjacent to the vessel wall. We hypothesize that the\nsmooth muscle cell-like adipocyte lineage in human PVAT contributes directly to the thermogenic adipocyte\nlineage in humans, and that the functional activity of this lineage inversely correlates to vascular disease\nprogression. This is a translational study with the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the molecular identity\nof the adipocyte progenitor cells in human PVAT, and cellular PVAT composition in vascular pathology. We will\nperform molecular studies to identify sub-populations of adipocyte progenitors and overall cellular composition\nin human PVAT, and identify associations with clinical and physiological measures of health and disease. Aim\n2. Identify the mechanisms driving functional capacity thermogenic adipocyte differentiation in human\nadipocyte progenitors, and impact on vascular smooth muscle cell physiology. Differentiation capacity will be\ntested in the fibroblast progenitor population and the SMC-like progenitor population, and paracrine signaling\nfrom adipocytes will be evaluated using human vascular SMC. Novel pathways identified from molecular\nstudies will inform studies to determine drivers of thermogenic differentiation. Our results are expected to\nidentify for the first time molecular signatures of PVAT corresponding to different vascular pathologies, and\ncharacterize critical adipocyte progenitor populations related to the differentiation of thermogenic adipocytes in\nhuman progenitor cells.",

The nervous system is a primary target of opioids through\nactivation of opioid receptors, and the innervation of bone, specifically by sensory neurons, is integral for bone\nhomeostasis. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and can be\nsecreted to affect various cell types, including bone cells. We have developed a model of opioid-induced bone\nloss through systemic morphine treatment, which significantly reduced trabecular bone microarchitecture, bone\nformation, and circulating miRNAs in male mice. Furthermore, several of the circulating miRNAs we identified\nwere also significantly decreased in the bone of morphine-treated mice and have known associations with\nbone outcomes and/or opioid use. miRNA, miR-484 may be integral to reduced osteoblast mineralization\nbased on high expression in healthy mouse and human bone, and it targets genes relevant to osteoblasts. This\nproposal will test the hypothesis that morphine suppresses neuronal miRNA expression, which impairs\nsensory-osteoblast communication through changes in gene expression and contributes to overall bone loss.\nIn Aim 1, we will explore the mechanism of miRNA suppression by morphine through decreased biogenesis\nand/or secretion within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which house the cell bodies of sensory neurons.\nSpecifically, we will treat mice with morphine for 2 or 4 weeks and determine how miRNA expression,\nbiogenesis, and secretion are associated with progressive bone loss. Conditioned media treatment of primary\nosteoblasts from morphine-treated DRG will determine whether morphine indirectly impairs osteoblast\nmineralization. In Aim 2, we will identify the specific role of miR-484 in osteoblast function through in situ\nanalysis of miR-484 in femora of morphine-treated mice as well as overexpression or knockdown of miR-484 in\nprimary osteoblasts. miR-484 gene targets will be assessed at the gene and protein level in addition to\nidentification of novel genes and pathways impacted by miR-484 through RNA sequencing. I will be trained and\nmentored by experts in the field at MHIR and external consultants, which will support my transition to a\npostdoctoral fellow focused on skeletal health. Findings will expand our understanding of opioid-induced bone\nloss through neural-skeletal miRNA communication. Further preclinical studies may then develop strategies to\nmitigate opioid-induced bone loss and inform clinical decisions in the face of the ongoing opioid epidemic.",

Currently available genetic-engineering approaches, including\nthe CRISPR-Cas9 system, which has revolutionized genome editing, lack the capacity for efficient integration of\nlarge DNA constructs (> 10 kilobases; kb) in mouse zygotes and mouse and human stem cells. This limitation\nsignificantly hinders the modeling of human diseases, including cancer. For example, tandem duplications (TDs),\nsuper-enhancers (SEs; large clusters of transcriptional enhancers), and large non-coding structural variants have\nbeen linked to human diseases, including cancers, but available technologies do not permit modeling such large\nvariants in whole animals or cell lines. To fill this gap, we will develop a gene-editing toolbox that couples the\nprecision of the CRISPR-Cas9 system with the fidelity and efficiency of the serine integrase Bxb1 to enable\nrapid, efficient insertion of large DNA constructs in mice, mouse embryonic stem cells, and human induced\npluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Bxb1 integrase uses DNA attachment sites (attP in the genome, attB in the\ndonor DNA) as substrates for catalyzing efficient transgenesis. We show that our innovative Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox\ncan precisely integrate DNA constructs up to ~43 kb in length in mice. Here, in three aims we will further develop\nand validate the toolbox to enable precise transgenesis of large DNA constructs (~100 kb) and to facilitate\ngeneration of DNA rearrangements. Aim 1: Optimize the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox for insertion of large DNA (10 to\n100 kb) constructs into mouse zygotes. We will use reporter constructs with differing lengths to determine the\nmaximum length of DNA construct that can be inserted efficiently, and will validate a one-step protocol for rapid\ngeneration of transgenic mice without the need to first generate and characterize mice with attachment sites.\nAim 2: Generate mouse and hiPSC models of human diseases, including cancer, using the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox.\nUsing our toolbox to insert large genomic variants, we will generate a mouse model of breast cancer (insertion\nof a 23.7-kb TD), hiPSC model of triple negative breast cancer (27.2-kb SE), and mouse model of Hirschsprung\ndisease (~80-kb human risk allele). Aim 3: Enable use of the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox for generation of DNA\nrearrangements. In cre-lox recombination systems, cre catalyzes recombination between two loxP sites flanking\na target locus, enabling diverse DNA rearrangements. Studies suggest that cre-recombination efficacy is limited\nby the inter-loxP-site distance and the particular genomic site targeted. We will determine whether the Cas9-\nBxb1 toolbox is more efficient than cre-lox for generation of DNA rearrangements, by determining Bxb1-mediated\nrecombination efficacy at different inter-attP/attB distances. Successful completion of this project will provide the\ncommunity with three new models for future studies, and a versatile tool for development of novel and improved\nmouse and hiPSC models of cancer and other diseases.",

Alternatively, therapeutic strategies to promote cognitive resilience in the face of AD\npathology are potentially effective methods to lessen the impact of AD. To identify gene candidates of\nresiliency I quantified neurodegeneration in the brains of the translationally-relevant AD-BXD mouse model of\nAD via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and used these imaging outcomes to complete genetic mapping. Using\nthis approach, I identified Leucine Rich Repeat And Fibronectin Type III Domain Containing 2 (Lrfn2) as a\npotentially causal gene modifying AD-related cortical neurodegeneration. I hypothesize that Lrfn2\noverexpression will rescue AD-related cortical neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline\nin the 5XFAD model of AD. I will test this hypothesis by developing a novel Lrfn2 overexpression transgenic\nmouse and evaluating the impact of changes in Lrfn2 expression on AD progression in three aims. Aim 1) I will\nmeasure the extent of cortical neurodegeneration in 5XFAD and nontransgenic mice with and without Lrfn2\noverexpression in both male and female mice at 6 and 14 months of age. Results will indicate whether Lrfn2 is\ntruly a causal modifier of cortical neurodegeneration. Aim 2a) To test the impact of Lrfn2 overexpression on\nsynaptic plasticity I will perform ex vivo whole-cell current-clamp electrophysiology recordings in a separate\ncohort of mice. I will determine if overexpression of Lrfn2 in excitatory forebrain neurons rescues long-term\npotentiation deficits in 5XFAD animals. Aim 2b) To investigate the effect of Lrfn2 on synaptic structure, I will\nimage dendritic spines to assess changes in spine morphology and density as a complementary measure of\nsynapse stability and synaptic function associated with cognitive performance. Aim 3) To evaluate the role of\nLrfn2 as a potential resilience factor to cognitive decline, I will execute mouse behavioral tasks measuring\nworking, short-term, long-term, and working memory in the same mice used in Aim 1. To our knowledge, this\nwill be the first study to evaluate Lrfn2 expression in the context of aging, AD, and cortical neurodegeneration.\nWith the successful completion of these aims, I will achieve my long-term goal for this project by determining\nwhether Lrfn2 modulation is a novel resilience therapeutic for AD treatment. The proposed work will facilitate\nthe achievement of my training goals to acquire new skills and knowledge related to IHC, imaging,\nelectrophysiology, dendritic spine characterization, behavioral assays, general wet-lab techniques, and\nprofessional development.

This new project will build on our current SEPA project which has a focus on arsenic in private\nwell water in rural communities. Based on what we are learning in our first project, that nearly all communities\nhave a mix of some public water systems as well as private wells, we will provide a more inclusive experience\nfor students by having them collect home drinking water samples for analysis, no matter what the source. We\nwill provide curriculum on drinking water systems so that students can identify their source of drinking water.\nWhile our first project focused on arsenic in wells, many schools found that uranium and lead and other\ncontaminants were also issues that need attention. So, we will develop curriculum that addresses multiple\ndrinking water contaminants and provide training for teachers in these areas. We have already developed data\nliteracy tools and curriculum that will serve teachers and students in this new project. With these supports in\nplace, our new SEPA project will focus on helping students create data visualizations so that they can more\neffectively communicate their findings to diverse audiences. We know from surveys of homeowners who\ncontributed well water samples in the first years of our current project, that the likelihood of mitigating arsenic in\ndrinking water was related to the extent of parent-child interactions in the home. To further support these\ninteractions, we will also focus on intergenerational learning. In guided focus sessions with parents, we will get\ntheir input on developing appropriate at-home conversation prompts and sink-side activities to engage families\nmore actively in understanding the importance of healthy drinking water. We anticipate that this approach,\ncombined with our expanded focus on multiple contaminants in drinking water from homes dependent on either\nprivate or public drinking water sources in either urban or rural environments will enable us to more broadly\ndisseminate our project and facilitate its replicability in other geographic areas.\n.",

Interrogating this complex\nlandscape of genes and developing community resources around them have traditionally involved modifying the\ngenome on a gene-by-gene and resource-by-resource basis with tremendous effort and at great cost. For\nexample, to create an animal resource containing a knockout of each mouse gene, the International Mouse\nKnockout Consortium has had to target each of 20,000 unique sequences at a combined cost of close to $1\nbillion (USD). Contributing to the funding and labor burden is the fact that each experiment is dependent upon\nthe technically challenging and labor-intensive microinjection of DNAs into fertilized oocytes, or embryonic stem\ncells into early developmental stage mouse blastocysts. Creating even a second, new genome-wide resource\nbased on each of 20,000 genes could conceivably require repeating the costly process yet again.\n To move beyond the one-by-one approach for developing genome-wide resources, outlined/envisioned in\nthis proposal, is a powerful combinatorial technology to sequentially marry functional DNA sequences (encoding,\nfor example, reporters, recombinases, cell-ablating toxins, protein interaction domains, and nucleases) to each\nof thousands of unique mouse genes already marked with a uniform (lacZ-) sequence tag.\n The potential for a breakthrough in genome analysis studies at the heart of the proposal comes from the\ncombination of two powerful and proven technologies \u2014 first, Prime Editing, a CRISPR technology employing\nReverse Transcriptase to insert DNA sequences at points of DNA modification; and second, expression of Prime\nEditing machinery directly from the genome (rather than administering it exogenously).\n The key aspect of the proposed experiments is to exploit the exquisite specificity of Prime Editing to guide\nthe reverse transcription of pegRNA edits/cargoes to multiple, specific, previously (e.g., lacZ-) tagged loci.\nImportantly, successful Prime Editing from specific pegRNAs will afford the opportunity to distribute novel\nfunctional sequences to thousands of mouse genes without any need for the costly, time-consuming\nmicroinjection of zygotes or embryonic stem cells.\n Full implementation of such as system has the potential to accelerate the development, increase the number,\nand decrease the cost of mouse genome-wide resources by orders of magnitude, and to move strain\ndevelopment efforts from a gene-by-gene method to a more massively parallel approach. The combinatorial\nnature of the technology and the adaptability of the system to incorporate the latest in new technological\ndevelopments will allow a longstanding contribution to human health.",

            "project_description": "Irisin is a novel signaling peptide proteolyzed from the cell membrane-bound protein Fndc5 (fibronectin type III\ndomain-containing protein 5), first described by our collaborators to release from muscle during exercise and\ninduce a thermogenic program in beige adipose tissue. A growing body of work has highlighted another key\nrole for irisin in mediating the effect of exercise on bone. Early work described an anabolic action, with\nintermittent low doses of irisin stimulating cortical bone formation and preventing unloading-induced bone loss\nin vivo, and serum-derived irisin from exercised mice enhancing osteoblastogenesis in vitro. Our group has\nemployed a genetic approach to further elucidate the role of irisin in skeletal remodeling, demonstrating that\nforced expression of Fndc5 in muscle markedly reduced bone formation and osteoblast numbers while\nincreasing sclerostin (SOST) expression and osteoclast numbers. Global genetic deletion of Fndc5 conferred\ncomplete protection against ovariectomy-induced bone loss, marked by maintenance of osteocyte lacunae and\nblocked bone resorption with no increases in Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-\u03b2 Ligand (RANKL)\nexpression despite prolonged estrogen deprivation. Similarly, short term irisin infusions in wild type mice\nresulted in higher serum levels of sclerostin and RANKL. These results highlight the breadth of irisin\u2019s signaling\neffects in bone, and the need to further understand its overall impact on resorption and remodelling. We now\nhave additional evidence that irisin signals directly to the osteoclast via integrin \u03b1V\u03b25, stimulating differentiation\nand resorption. The present work endeavors to delineate the full signaling pathway in the osteoclast, while\nemploying novel in vivo models to test this regulation of resorption in the context of skeletal response to\nexercise. We have developed a novel conditional mouse allele of Fndc5 and generated a skeletal muscle-\nspecific targeted null, which we will use to test the effect of muscle-derived irisin on bone response to exercise.\nIn parallel, we will utilize in vitro techniques to confirm the putative receptors for irisin and characterize\nintracellular signal transduction in the osteoclast. To comprehensively assess irisin\u2019s impact on bone\nresorption, we will also investigate indirect effects of irisin on the osteoclast, through regulation by the\nosteocyte. Finally, as osteocyte response to mechanical cues is a key aspect of this cell\u2019s function during\nexercise, we will investigate the potential interplay between irisin signaling and mechanosensitivity. We predict\npleiotropic effects of irisin \u2013 it may be a coupling factor by directly stimulating both the osteoblast and\nosteoclast, and also serve a unique role as a counter regulatory hormone to maintain calcium homeostasis by\nincreasing resorption. By focusing on the osteoclast, this work seeks to elucidate irisin\u2019s role in initiating bone\nresorption and better understand its influence on remodeling as a whole. Such insights both provide a greater\nunderstanding of skeletal response to exercise but inform efforts to address bone degenerative diseases by\ntaking advantage of native signaling pathways.",

To address this issue, a clinical trial using beta blockers\n(BBs) to improve bone health has recently been funded entitled, \u201cBeta1-selective blockade for prevention of\npostmenopausal bone loss: A randomized controlled trial\u201d (R01 AG065154-A1). While this trial will evaluate the\nefficacy and safety of BBs for this indication, questions will remain about the mechanism and optimal use of\nthis prevention strategy. Heterogeneity of BB effects on bone outcomes have been observed and may be due\nto pharmacogenetics, as we have discovered and validated pharmacogenetic variants in ADRB1 and HDAC4.\nFurthermore, the mechanisms of treatment effect remain controversial. Although previous mouse studies\nshowed that the beneficial bone effects of BBs were due to competitive binding to B2-adrenergic receptors\n(B2-ARs) on osteoblasts, many human studies have found B1-selective blockers to be associated with better\nbone outcomes. In addition, we have discovered that miR-19a-3p, which we hypothesize to target B1-AR\n(ADRB1), is associated with BB use and higher bone mineral density (BMD). We also show a\npharmacogenetic association in an ADRB1 variant, which is positively associated with miR-19a-3p expression.\nIn mouse studies, we have shown a novel direct effect of BB treatment on osteoclasts that is not mediated by\nosteoblast signaling. In summary, our preliminary pharmacogenetic and microRNA results underscore the\nimportance of B1-AR in addition to B2-AR signaling for BB bone effects, and our mouse studies show evidence\nof direct effects of BB treatment on osteoclasts in addition to indirect effects via osteoblasts. Our central\nhypothesis is that genetic and microRNA (miRNA) variables associated with treatment response contribute to\nmodulation of B1-AR and B2-AR signaling pathways in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We will test this\nhypothesis via the following specific aims: 1) Measure the effect of in vivo atenolol treatment on differentiation\nin participant-derived osteoclasts, discover and validate pharmacogenetic variants of atenolol treatment\nresponse, and characterize their functional effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts. 2) Use miRNA-seq to\nidentify circulating miRNAs associated with treatment response, and discover targets and validate mechanisms\nin osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We propose to rigorously perform these aims using participant-derived samples\nfrom the previously mentioned trial. This proposal will allow us to characterize the mechanisms of BB treatment\neffect on bone in post-menopausal women and to create personalized treatment models.",

At the cellular level, exercise\nenhances synaptic connectivity and reduces markers of neuroinflammation in aging cortical circuits. Exactly how\nexercise signals in the brain generate these neuroprotective effects remains unknown. Our preliminary\nexperiments have identified a set of neurons in the mouse ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) expressing\nSteroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) that robustly increase their activity in response to exercise. We have found that\nthe VMH SF-1 neural activity signal is potentiated severalfold following repeated exercise, suggesting that the\nexercise signals generated by VMH SF-1 neurons are plastic and shaped by experience. Furthermore, we have\nfound that direct stimulation of SF-1 neurons substantially increases subsequent endurance capacity, suggesting\nVMH Sf-1 neurons are an important neural node controlling the physiological benefits of exercise. However,\nseveral important questions remain unknown. First, which features of VMH SF-1 neurons enables plasticity of\nactivity signals following repeated exercise? Second, which specific sets of VMH SF-1 output neurons transmit\nexercise-relevant signals? Last, is it possible to stimulate VMH SF-1 neurons and generate the neuroprotective\neffects of exercise on cognition and neural circuitry in the aging brain or in AD-like states? The proposed\nexperiments will leverage advanced neuroanatomical and neurophysiological tools with preclinical genetic\nmodels to gain insights into these questions. In Aim 1, we will pair large-volume, high-resolution, and cell-type\nspecific array tomographic neuroanatomical reconstructions with in vivo calcium imaging and neuronal activity\nperturbations to determine how exercise shapes the synaptic architecture of VMH SF-1 neurons. These\nexperiments will define how changes in the synaptic inputs to these neurons might physically `store' exercise\nhistory within VMH circuitry. In Aim 2, we will use advanced viral mapping and in vivo single-cell functional\nimaging techniques to identify which neurons are activated by exercise and understand how these exercise\nsignals are transmitted to specific circuits downstream of the VMH. These experiments will define the\norganization and logic by which exercise-related activity in VMH neurons drives functional changes in the brain.\nIn Aim 3, we will take advantage of advanced preclinical genetic mouse models of early- and late-onset AD to\ndetermine whether stimulating activity in VMH neurons might recapitulate the neuroprotective effects of exercise\nobserved in cortical circuits. These experiments will increase our understanding of how signals in the VMH could\nbe harnessed for therapeutic manipulation in disease states. By leveraging the synergistic expertise of the team\nof investigators assembled to address this problem, insights from these experiments will advance our\nfundamental understanding of how the beneficial effects of exercise are mediated by specific synapses, cell-\ntypes, and circuits, and whether these features are potential therapeutic targets for intervention in disease states.",

            "project_description": "SUMMARY\nAlternative RNA splicing is a key step in gene expression regulation and contributes to transcriptional diversity\nby selecting which transcript isoforms are produced in a specific cell at a specific time point. Aberrantly spliced\nisoforms can impact every one of the hallmarks of cancer, including increased cell proliferation, migration, or\nresistance to apoptosis. Regulatory splicing factors (SFs) have recently emerged as a new class of oncoproteins\nand tumor suppressors. In particular, the tumorigenic capacity of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC, which\nis dysregulated in >50% of human tumors, has been shown to be dependent on the splicing machinery and on\nat least 3 SFs directly regulated by MYC. However, we currently do not have a comprehensive understanding of\nwhich component(s) of the splicing machinery are regulated by MYC, or of the functions of MYC-induced spliced\nisoforms. The goal of this proposal is to systematically characterize the mechanisms by which MYC-regulated\nSFs and spliced isoforms drive tumor growth and maintenance. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, in\nour preliminary studies we used a mammary cell line harboring an inducible form of MYC to greatly expand the\nnumber of known SFs regulated by MYC. We uncovered that MYC activation promotes alternative splicing of\n>4,000 isoforms and expression of 125 SFs. These SFs are also upregulated in MYC-active breast tumors and\ncan be grouped, based on co-expression, into groups or modules. Six SF-modules highly correlate with MYC\nactivity in breast tumors and cell lines, and are enriched in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Which of these\nSFs play a role in MYC-driven transformation, and whether co-expression of multiple MYC-induced SFs has a\nstronger tumorigenic effect than individual SFs, is not known. Further, co-expression analysis in 33 TCGA tumors\nof different tissue origin identified an SF-module shared across all MYC-active tumors, suggesting a pan-cancer\nvulnerability. We hypothesize that MYC regulates a network of SFs which cooperate in tumor pathogenesis and\nthat disrupting this network could provide a novel strategy to slow growth of MYC-driven tumors. Here, we will\nleverage our expertise in RNA splicing and cancer biology and apply a functional genomics approach to gain\nnovel insights into MYC's oncogenicity. Aim 1 will characterize the function of 6 MYC-induced SF modules and\ntheir splicing targets in TNBC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Since it is unknown whether MYC regulates a\nshared set of isoforms in distinct tissues, Aim 2 will identify pan-cancer splicing signatures predictive of MYC\nactivity and clinical outcomes, which may serve as clinical biomarkers, and will deliver putative neo-antigens\ngenerated from MYC-induced isoforms. Finally, Aim 3 will implement genomic approaches to determine which\nMYC-induced isoforms are essential for the growth of MYC-driven cancer cells and patient-derived organoids.\nThis project will reveal fundamental mechanisms by which oncogenic SFs and their target spliced isoforms drive\ntumorigenesis downstream of MYC. These results could help inform development of therapeutic strategies for\ntumors driven by MYC, which remains an undruggable target.",

However, many questions remain. Namely, are the identified GWA\nhits disease-causing variants or are they simply closely linked markers? And if the GWA hits are disease-causing\nvariants, how do disruptions in these molecules lead to the observed pathologies? Further, since AMD is\nmultifactorial, to what extent do particular combinations of factors precipitate AMD disease phenotypes or\nincrease disease severity, as has been suggested to be the case in large scale GWA studies, where CFH and\nARMS2/HTRA1 (locus on Chr. 10q26) appear to have synergistic effects on disease risk. Together they explain\n>50% of the genetic variability observed in AMD. Furthermore, since ARMS2 and HTRA1 are in strong linkage\ndisequilibrium, it has been difficult to decipher whether either or both genes contribute to AMD-pathologies.\n The issues raised above can be addressed, in part, with appropriate animal models. Although mice do not\nhave a macula per se, they faithfully recapitulate many aspects of retinal degenerative diseases and have been\nused to learn how disruption of certain molecules lead to AMD-like pathologies. In this application, we will seek\nin vivo confirmation of the cell-type and subcellular localization of ARMS2, and establish whether mice bearing\nthe ARMS2A69S allele independently develop AMD-like sub-phenotypes and explore potential molecular\nmechanisms underlying the changes. Finally, because AMD is a multifactorial disease, we will examine if AMD-\nassociated risk factors such as such as diet or genetic variants, such as CFH risk alleles, can potentiate AMD-\nlike disease phenotypes.\n Identifying the pathogenic pathways and mechanisms underlying the disease sub-phenotypes, the goal of\nthis proposal, is critical for developing effective therapies that can target the pre-symptomatic stage to prevent,\ndelay onset or decrease severity of the disease.

We seek to understand the biochemical and cellular basis for these diseases, to test mechanisms that could explain their specificity for motor and sensory neurons, and to test possible pharmacological and gene therapy-based treatments. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a collection of inherited diseases of the peripheral nervous system, and close to 100 genes are associated with CMT. The largest gene family associated with CMT is the tRNA synthetases. These enzymes charge amino acids onto their cognate tRNAs, and mutations in at least six cause peripheral neuropathy. Our preliminary data show that mutations in glycyl- and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Gars and Yars, respectively) in mouse models lead to the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) through the kinase GCN2. Genetic deletion of Gcn2 alleviates the phenotype of Gars/CMT2D mouse models. GCN2 is activated by uncharged tRNAs and also stalled ribosomes, and genetic interaction studies are consistent with ribosome stalling in vivo. Furthermore, uncharged tRNAs should be rescued by overexpression of wild-type synthetase, and we have shown this does not happen in Gars mouse models. Instead we favor a mechanism in which the tRNA substrate becomes limiting. We propose the following model: The mutant synthetases have aberrantly increased affinity for their cognate tRNAs, effectively sequestering them. This leads to ribosome stalling at the relevant codons during translation, which activates GCN2 and the ISR. The chronic activation of the ISR contributes to disease. We propose three aims to test this model. In Aim 1, we will directly measure the affinities of wild-type and mutant synthetases for their cognate tRNAs, anticipating that mutant synthetases will have higher affinities and slower off rates. We will also develop cell-based models using pluripotent human cell lines engineered to carry neuropathy-associated tRNA synthetase alleles. Differentiating these cells to motor neurons will validate our model in human cells and enable studies ribosome stalling and other relevant cell biology. We can also combine these systems predictively to create pathogenic or protective mutations, correlating tRNA affinity, ribosome stalling, induction of the ISR, and severity of neuropathy. In Aim 2, we will test possible mechanisms underlying the specificity of the disease. The tRNA synthetase genes are ubiquitously expressed, and the change in affinity should not be cell-type specific. Therefore, motor and sensory neurons may be particularly susceptible to ribosome stalling and the induction of the ISR, or may be particularly sensitive to tRNA sequestration due to high expression of the synthetase genes or poor expression of tRNAs. In Aim 3, we will test whether pharmacological inhibition of the ISR is beneficial, as suggested by our genetic studies with Gcn2 knockout mice. We will also test if the phenotype is rescued (which we anticipate) or exacerbated using AAV9 vectors to increase tRNA expression. These studies are potentially translational, and also directly test our proposed tRNA sequestration mechanism.",

Regeneration\nin adult mammals is extremely limited; damaged tissue in most major organs fails to regenerate, and instead\nundergoes scar-based repair. The lack of adult regenerative capacity is an enormous burden on the healthcare\nsystem and society as a whole. Although both human and mouse digit tips can undergo a true regenerative\nresponse, this regeneration is positionally restricted to the terminal distal phalanx bone. Importantly, amputations\nwith an axis point below the terminal distal phalanx bone or too close to the nail bed result in regeneration failure.\nNotably, salamander limbs have an anatomy similar to that of human limbs, but uniquely regenerate after\namputation from any position throughout adult life. The biological mechanisms limiting regeneration in adult\nmammals is poorly understood. Although the immune system is a powerful regulator of wound repair, the exact\nrole of immune-cell networks as a determinant of regenerative success has been grossly understudied. In our\nregeneration studies, including those proposed here, we use the mouse digit-tip model, examining regeneration\nfollowing tissue removal at different digit locations. This is a powerful model, as regeneration can be measured\nnon-invasively with high-resolution micro-computed tomography 3D-imaging (bone/soft tissue volume), and\nanalyzed comprehensively using histology and molecular analysis. We identified several lymphoid immune-cell\ntypes that inhibit mouse digit-tip regeneration via cytotoxic activity against progenitor cells and showed that T-\nregulatory cells (Tregs) play a critical role in protecting progenitors from these cells. We also found that in mice\nlacking lymphoid immunity, novel regeneration is induced, providing new models to identify pro-regenerative\ncells and molecular pathways that can be exploited therapeutically. Importantly, we also identified several\nlymphoid-cell types that support regeneration, suggesting the potential to therapeutically enhance human repair\nthrough targeted immunomodulation. This project aims to identify and characterize the mechanisms by which\nlymphoid cells regulate adult regeneration. Specifically, we will: Aim 1: Dissect and characterize lymphoid-cell\nmechanisms inhibiting regeneration. We will use a range of mouse strains with mutations in cytotoxic function in\nex vivo and in vivo analyses. Aim 2: Define mechanisms of pro-regenerative Treg suppression of lymphoid-cell\ncytotoxicity using Treg-specific deletion of functional genes in vivo.

We will test tolerogenic molecules in ex vivo\ncytotoxicity assays and then evaluate tolerogenic antigen overexpression in vivo both direct transgenic and viral\napproaches and then via a modified Treg delivery strategy.

It is the most common inherited glomerular disease leading to renal failure and is caused by mutations\nin any one of the genes encoding a3, a4, or a5 chains of type IV collagen (COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5,\nrespectively). There is large variation in the age of onset and severity of the disease, even between patients with\nsimilar mutations. Studies in mice have shown that the renal phenotype is highly dependent on the genetic\nbackground. It is widely accepted that modifier genes contribute to this variation, which could represent a source\nof novel therapeutic targets in Alport syndrome and other renal diseases.

We will generate a large, genetically diverse XLAS\nmouse population that, combined with our previous population, will allow us gene-resolution mapping of modifier\nloci (Aim 1). Whole exome sequencing and targeted testing for the detection of the most likely candidate modifier\ngenes in human XLAS pedigrees will be conducted to confirm the translational relevance of the candidate\nmodifier genes found in our mouse studies (Aim 2). We will use available knockout resources and/or CRISPR-\nCas9 gene editing to test causality of as many as five candidate genes in the XLAS mouse model (Aim 3A). We\nwill further test these modifier genes for causality in mouse models of two common forms of kidney disease:\ndiabetic nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis syndrome (Aim 3B). Identification of the genes\nresponsible for the onset and severity of disease will provide meaningful insights into understanding the\nmolecular events underlying the pathogenesis of kidney disease and provide the basis for developing novel\ntherapeutic strategies.",

Timely access to STEM materials is one of the biggest challenges for BVI learners, limiting their\nproductivity and success. While access to textual information has largely been solved via screen reading software\n(e.g., JAWS or VoiceOver), very little progress has been made in making non-textual (i.e., graphical) information\naccessible for BVI people. With STEM curricula being dominated by non-textual information (e.g., diagrams,\ngraphs, charts, images, mathematical notations), the visual nature of this critical information prevents more than\n660,000 school-aged (ages 4-21) BVI learners from pursuing STEM curricula. Current technologies/devices\naddress the issue via human-driven approaches using specialized single purpose hardware that suffer from\nseveral shortcomings including high cost, limited portability, lack of multi-purpose, and inability to present\ninformation in a real-time context. Importantly, a common underlying problem across all extant approaches is\nthat they require intensive human efforts for producing or authoring tactile (and/or multimodal) graphics. These\napproaches lead to high production costs and significant delays from the time the accessible materials are needed\nto when they are actually delivered; ultimately adversely impacting BVI individuals\u2019 learning and advancement\nin K-12 schools, colleges, and performance in workplace settings. To address this long-standing problem, in\nPhase I, UNAR Labs developed a prototype version of Midlina\u2019s framework using Math worksheets as an\nexample and demonstrated its practical utility by implementing it on a prototype web application, called Kanak.\nIn this Phase II effort, UNAR Labs will build on the success of Phase I by extending the capability of Midlina\u2019s\nframework and establishing it as a commercially viable platform technology for generating/converting STEM\nmaterials into accessible formats. We will also develop and deploy two Midlina-powered applications, (1) Kanak\n\u2013a web application aimed at aiding teachers and TVIs with real-time accessible document creation, and (2)\nMathAlly \u2013 an IOS app that helps BVI learners access accessible math materials in real-time. The team is highly\nexperienced in developing assistive technology solutions. Successful completion of the project will provide a\nrobust system for increasing the participation of BVI individuals in STEM programs and will make educational\ninstitutions more inclusive and equitable.",

            "project_title": "Tissue-specific roles for muscle-matrix adhesion in neuromuscular development and homeostasis",
            "project_description": "Musculoskeletal function requires integration of skeletal muscle with two different junctions: neuromuscular\njunctions (NMJs) and myotendinous junctions (MTJs). Action potentials are transmitted through NMJs to\nsignal muscle contraction. Muscle contraction then transmits force through MTJs to move the skeleton.\nDisruption of either of these junctions can lead to incurable neuromuscular degenerative\ndiseases that shorten lifespan and deleteriously impact quality of life. Despite their importance, the\nmechanisms underlying coordinated development and homeostasis of NMJs, muscle, and MTJs are not\nentirely understood. NMJs and MTJs connect to muscle through cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion\ncomplexes such as the Dystrophin Glycoprotein Complex. Dystroglycan (DG) is a critical transmembrane\nreceptor in the Dystrophin Glycoprotein Complex that requires glycosylation to bind to the ECM. A critical\nbuilding block for DG glycosylation is Dolichylphosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man), which is generated by the\nDol-P-Man synthase complex. Humans with mutations in any of the three components of this complex\n(Dpm1,2,3) can show failure to thrive and they have progressive muscle degeneration, resulting in a life\nexpectancy of 20 years or less. Thus, glycosylation plays critical roles in NMJ and MTJ integrity. We propose to\nuse the zebrafish model to provide insight into the basic cell biology underlying neuromusculoskeletal diseases\nwhere glycosylation is disrupted as a necessary step towards identifying future therapeutic targets. To\nunderstand how loss of Dol-P-Man leads to muscle degeneration, we generated a zebrafish model with\ntruncated Dpm3, the stabilizing subunit in Dol-P-Man synthesis. In dpm3 mutants, NMJ and MTJ\ndevelopment are disrupted, muscle growth is reduced, there is neuromuscular degeneration, and death occurs\nby 3 weeks. We next created dpm3;dg double mutants to determine whether glycosylation of DG by Dpm3 is\nresponsible for this phenotype. The enhanced phenotype of dpm3;dg homozygous double mutants, with severe\nmuscle degeneration and death by just 1 week, suggests that DG-independent actions of Dol-P-Man have been\noverlooked. We will use our unique genetic models to elucidate cell-type specific noncanonical functions for\nDpm3 and Dg to test the overall hypothesis that DPM3 and DG play interrelated and independent roles that\nare critical for cell-matrix adhesion in NMJs, muscle, and MTJs formation and maintenance. We will do this\nby completing the following two aims. Aim 1: Elucidate motor neuron- and muscle-specific roles for Dol-P-Man\nand DG at the NMJ. Aim 2: Determine how Dol-P-Man and DG play unique and synergistic roles to promote\ncell-matrix adhesion during MTJ development and muscle growth. Taken together, experiments in this\nproposal will integrate our unique genetic models to elucidate cell-type specific canonical and noncanonical\nroles for Dpm3 and Dg with powerful imaging approaches to quantitatively understand the coordination\nbetween the NMJ and MTJ during development and homeostasis in normal and diseased states.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAging is associated with functional decline of the hematopoietic system and clonal hematopoiesis (CH), a\npoorly understood process by which long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their progeny with certain\nsomatic mutations undergo positive selection. Individuals with CH have increased risk of developing blood\ncancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Thus, CH is a healthspan-limiting\ncondition. Understanding how and why CH occurs with aging, and defining effective interventions to extend\nhealthspan, have strong potential to reduce the frequency or severity of CH-associated diseases in aged\nindividuals. Our laboratory has recently made formative discoveries that the aging bone marrow\nmicroenvironment and impaired HSC mitochondrial function cooperate to cause HSC aging. These\ndiscoveries have inspired us to define the components of aging that contribute to positive selection of CH-\nmutant HSCs. The major goal of this proposal is to determine processes by which hematopoietic-intrinsic and\n-extrinsic factors cause age-associated CH. Using a mouse model of a common CH mutation in DNMT3A, our\npreliminary data demonstrate that both hematopoietic-intrinsic and -extrinsic adaptive mechanisms facilitate\nselective advantage of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs in the context of aging. We hypothesize that Dnmt3a-mutant\nHSCs are adapted to survive and self-renew in an aging microenvironment through enhanced mitochondrial\nmetabolism, and that they promote premature senescence of the microenvironment to further their selective\nadvantage. In Aim 1, we will identify the specific mitochondrial alterations in Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs that\nfunctionally increase their competitive advantage in an aging microenvironment. In Aim 2, we will determine\nthe mechanisms by which Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs induce senescence of mesenchymal stromal cells in the BM\nmicroenvironment. In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which targeting mesenchymal stromal cell\nsenescence will reduce the functional competitive advantage of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs and progression to\nhematologic pathology. Successful completion of this project will determine the mechanisms by which\nhematopoietic-intrinsic and -extrinsic processes confer a competitive advantage to Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs\nduring aging. We expect that understanding these mechanisms will allow prioritization of targets for\ntherapeutic intervention to limit CH-associated pathologies including myeloid malignancies, cardiovascular\ndisease, and type 2 diabetes.",

            "project_description": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThe obesity epidemic is a global public health issue, that leads to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and\ncardiovascular disease. Hypertrophy, inflammation, and excess lipid accumulation in white adipocytes within\nfat tissue are hallmarks of obesity that contribute to metabolic dysfunction. Unlike white adipocytes, beige\nadipocytes are rich in mitochondria, and expend energy to generate heat (thermogenesis) in response to\nstimuli such as cold exposure. This activity is associated with resistance to diet-induced obesity, and thus\nactivation and expansion of beige adipocytes can counteract the obesity phenotype. During beige adipocyte\nactivation, optimal thermogenic function is maintained by balancing mitochondrial biogenesis with autophagy-\nmediated mitochondrial degradation (mitophagy), which is finely coordinated to maintain mitochondrial\nhomeostasis. Using our newly developed model of beige adipocyte differentiation and activation from human\niPS cells, we discovered that thermogenic activation of beige adipocytes occurs following enhanced secretion\nof exosomes containing a variety of microRNAs (miRs), including miR-27a/b. miR-27 homologs (miR-27a/b)\nare anti-thermogenic miRs that suppress genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (such as FOXJ3) and\nmitophagy (including MFF). miR-27a/b are down-regulated in beige adipocytes during thermogenic activation,\nconsistent with their predicted role as inhibitors of mitochondrial activation, turnover, and biogenesis. This\nproject tests several hypotheses related to mechanisms of beige adipocyte activation. We propose that the\nmiR-27 suppresses adipocyte thermogenesis by targeting FOXJ3 and MFF and that loss of miR-27a/b and\nincrease in FOXJ3/MFF-mediated pathways activate mitochondrial activity and thermogenesis. We also\npropose that in vivo genetic targeting of miR-27a/b will allow us to identify the in vivo role of these miRs in\nbeige adipocyte activation, regulation of mitochondrial proteins, thermogenesis and resistance to obesity.\nThese questions will be tested in two focused specific aims:\nSpecific Aim 1. Identify the mechanism of miR-27 regulation of beige adipocyte mitochondrial function.\nSpecific Aim 2. Determine the effect of miR-27 suppression on the response of beige adipose tissue to\ntemperature challenge and high-fat diet.\nThese studies are expected to identify novel molecular mechanisms that may provide a new platform to\nincrease beige adipogenesis and reverse obesity-related disorders.",

While physiological corneal pain (nociceptive pain) protects the eye from injury,\ninflammation and/or nerve damage can result in prolonged or chronic corneal pain. Corneal afferents represent\na diverse population of neurons, with specialized properties related to maintaining ocular health. The full\ndiversity of these neurons, and their responses to injury are unknown. The first set of experiments will\ndetermine the mRNA transcript signatures of mouse corneal neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and their\ntranscriptional responses to corneal injury and compare with cell-type-specific transcriptional and epigenomic\nsignatures of human TG neurons. Corneal afferents are known to project to two main regions in the spinal\ntrigeminal nucleus (Vsp), each with distinct roles in nociception and maintaining corneal homeostasis. We have\npreliminary data demonstrating an additional projection to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a region\ncritical in regulating complex motivational-affective responses to aversive stimuli. Its contribution to corneal\npain is unknown. The second set of experiments will examine central processing of corneal input in the lPBN.\nWe will determine the contribution of corneal->lPBN primary afferent projections to corneal nociceptive\nresponses and the function of lPBN neurons in corneal nociceptive and chronic pain behaviors. Additional\nstudies will perform single-nucleus transcriptome analysis to identify molecular profiles of corneal-activated\nbrainstem neurons, followed by multiplex in situ hybridization to provide spatial resolution in regions that\nreceive direct corneal afferent input. The cornea is also endowed with resident corneal leukocytes (RCLs)\nresiding in close proximity to corneal nerves, suggesting the possibility of neuro-immune crosstalk in the\ncornea. However, current knowledge is limited on possible direct regulation of RCLs through corneal nerves, or\nthe influence of RCLs on corneal nerve function. The third set of experiments will characterize the cell\npopulations and molecular mechanisms involved in neuroimmune crosstalk resulting in peripheral nerve\nsensitization in the cornea. Corneal single cell mRNA transcript signatures associated in murine corneal pain\nmodels will be used to identify transcriptional changes that underly nociceptor sensitization. Crossing these\nimmune cell transcripts with transcript profiles of corneal afferents will provide evidence for ligand-receptor\npairs. In vitro studies will confirm the ability of the identified modulators to sensitize TG neurons, and the\nfunctional significance will be assessed using behavior and ex vivo electrophysiology. Employing a\nmultidisciplinary approach, these experiments will provide a comprehensive analysis of cellular and molecular\nmechanisms of nociceptive and chronic corneal pain, leading to the identification novel pathways and\ntreatments.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nDeafness at birth frequently originates from defects in the development of sensory cells in the inner ear. Likewise,\nhearing degradation during life frequently follows damage sustained by these cells after normal development. In\neach case, a particularly susceptible cellular compartment is the hair bundle, a specialized structure in each\nsensory cell that detects and relays sound-borne vibrations. The hair bundle is an array of actin-based membrane\nprotrusions, or stereocilia, precisely organized in rows of graded heights. Although the tiered architecture of the\nhair bundle is fundamental for sensory function, the molecular machinery required for its assembly during\ndevelopment and for the maintenance of its exact dimensions during life remains obscure. To address these\nopen questions, we propose to exploit knowledge gained from our ongoing investigations of the GPSM2-G\u03b1i\nprotein complex in mouse. Absence of the scaffold protein GPSM2 or inhibitory G proteins (G\u03b1i) result in\ndefective hair bundle assembly, a likely etiology for congenital hearing loss in Chudley-McCullough syndrome.\nThe GPSM2-G\u03b1i protein complex is first enriched on one side of the nascent hair bundle only (the bare zone),\nand then enriched at the tip of stereocilia in the adjacent first row, a distribution required for proper stereocilia\nplacement and elongation, respectively. We showed that the Myosin-15A motor transports GPSM2-G\u03b1i to\nstereocilia tips, where in turn GPSM2-G\u03b1i increases Myosin-15A amounts compared to other rows to define the\ntallest identity of the first row. Based on detailed preliminary data, we hypothesize that, 1) As yet unstudied G\u03b1i\nregulators act as upstream cues to selectively enrich the GPSM2-G\u03b1i complex only in the bare zone region of\nthe apical membrane and only in a single row of stereocilia. 2) Prior GPSM2-G\u03b1i enrichment on one side of the\nnascent hair bundle is the mechanism by which GPSM2-G\u03b1i becomes restricted to abutting stereocilia in the\nfirst row, giving the hair bundle its tiered architecture. 3) Continued enrichment of GPSM2-G\u03b1i at stereocilia tips\nafter development has a role in maintenance of proper stereocilia height and girth in adult hair bundles. To test\nthese hypotheses, we will: 1) Characterize the role of a negative G\u03b1i protein regulator that we already established\nas a new deafness gene critical for GPSM2-G\u03b1i complex localization and hair bundle morphogenesis. 2) Use a\nnew chemical protein labeling technology and new reporter mouse models to track discrete pools of GPSM2-\nG\u03b1i and follow their dynamic trafficking to the bare zone and stereocilia tips in time. 3) Inactivate GPSM2-G\u03b1i\nfunction in structurally and functionally normal hair bundles in adults, and monitor stereocilia dimensions,\nstereocilia actin dynamics and mouse auditory function. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms that shape\nand preserve hair bundles will help interpret and design treatments for sensory cell dysfunction, the principal\ncause of hearing loss.",

HIV-SN frequently manifests with hard-to-manage pain and is often\nunder-diagnosed and/or under-treated, yet, the large variation in prevalence does not allow for detection of\nsignificant differences in prevalence between HAART-exposed vs. HAART-non-exposed individuals. There is\nno specific FDA-approved treatment for HIV-SN. Tat, trans-activator of transcription, a regulatory protein\namong the first proteins expressed following HIV infection, is a key activator of HIV transcription and can affect\nboth HIV infected cells and non-infected neighboring cells via its secretion by infected cells. Although human\nstudies are lacking, recent animal studies using two models of doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic\n(iTat) mice from our lab and others provided convincing evidence that HIV Tat contributes to the development\nof HIV-SN. Therefore, in this proposal, we will further investigate the underlying mechanisms of Tat-associated\nSN. Our preliminary study identified potential regulation of Tat of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway.\nGiven the widely accepted involvement of TLR pathway in neuropathic pain and surprising lack of studies\nexploring the role of TLR pathway in HIV-SN, we will focus on TLR pathway in Tat-associated SN in this study.\nWe will take advantage of bioinformatic tools to identify FDA-approved drugs without significant interactions\nwith existing antiretroviral drugs that could potentially reverse Tat-induced changes in TLR pathway, and then\ntest their effectiveness in treating Tat-associated SN in vivo. Altogether, we hypothesize that TLR signaling\npathway is involved in the development of HIV-Tat-associated SN and it is possible to identify potential\ntreatment for HIV-SN by examining existing drugs via a combined bioinformatics and pre-clinical model\napproach. This will be tested through 2 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the contribution of Tollip (a key\nregulator of TLR pathway)-regulated TLR pathways in HIV Tat-associated SN using genetically modified\nanimal models in combination with behavioral and physiological tests. Aim 2 will identify potential drugs for\nHIV-SN by targeting TLR pathway via a combined bioinformatics and pre-clinical model approach.

A clearer mechanistic understanding of bone loss associated with bariatric surgery is necessary to\nproperly design preventive strategies. Changes in gut hormones and microbiota have been proposed to drive\nbone loss, but the effects of loss of the stomach have been largely neglected. We propose that gastric\nsecretory factors contribute to bariatric surgery-induced skeletal complications. In key preliminary data, we\nfound a loss of gastric X/A-like cells (P/D1 cell in humans) and a decrease in secreted ghrelin following VSG.\nGenetic ablation of X/A-like cells was found to improve glucose metabolism and impair trabecular bone mass,\nwhich mimics the metabolic and skeletal consequences of VSG. However, ghrelin supplementation alone does\nnot prevent VSG-induced bone loss. Our proteomic profiling identified ghrelin and somatostatin as the top two\nsecretory proteins enriched in X/A-like cells and decreased by VSG. Moreover, circulating exosome\nconcentrations and gastric RAB27A, a Rab GTPase critical for extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion, were\nsignificantly upregulated by VSG. These data suggest that X/A-like cells are a source of secretory factors vital\nto bone homeostasis, and bariatric surgery disrupts this balance. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to\ndefine the skeletal and metabolic consequences of gastric X/A-like cell ablation and identify X/A-like cell-\nderived secretory factors that affect skeletal homeostasis; and 2) to determine the effects of gastric X/A-like\ncell-derived hormonal factors and EV cargoes on VSG-induced bone loss. In aim 1, we will utilize the X/A-like\ncell ablation mouse model to determine the importance of these cells in skeletal health under conditions of\nmetabolic stress, including diet-induced obesity and estrogen deficiency. Furthermore, we will identify\nsecretory factors from X/A-like cells and determine their roles in osteoblast, osteoclast and adipocyte\ndifferentiation and function. In aim 2, we will test whether somatostatin can enhance the pro-osteogenic effects\nof ghrelin and protect against VSG-induced bone complications. In addition, we will delete Rab27a in X/A-like\ncells to determine its pathophysiological functions in bone, glucose and lipid metabolism under lean healthy,\nobese and VSG conditions. Understanding the significance of X/A-like cells in bone metabolism holds promise\nfor developing new therapeutic targets to manage bariatric surgery-induced bone loss, which remains one of\nthe few time-tested options for improving health of severely obese individuals.",

Among children, the heritable disease - Leber Congenital Amaurosis,\naccounts for 20% of blindness, and 10-15%of those are caused by mutations in the CRB1 gene. In addition to\nLCA, CRB1 mutations can also cause congenital or early-onset retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a more slowly\nprogressive disease. CRB1 RP variants are sometimes associated with unique disease features, such as\nretinal telangiectasia with or without exudative retinal detachment (Coat's disease), a loss of RPE pigmentation\nexcept near arterioles (preservation of para-arteriolar RPE or PPRPE), pigment paravenous chorioretinal\natrophy, cone-rod dystrophy, nanophthalmos with optic disc drusen, retinoschisis, cystoid macular edema, and\nmacular dystrophic disease. The cause of the wide range of disease phenotypes associated\nwith CRB1 mutations is not fully understood. Genotype-phenotype correlations that could explain the disease\nspectrum have not been detected among patients bearing CRB1 mutations, suggesting that environmental\nfactors or genetic background modifiers contribute to the variability in the disease phenotypes observed.\nAnother potential contributor to the phenotypic variability in disease presentation are Crb1 isoforms which have\nrecently been shown to have spatially and temporally distinct expression patterns. Clearly, understanding the\nreasons for the variability and the mechanisms underlying the observed pathologies is extremely important for\ndeveloping effective therapies.\nIn this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that pathological changes due to Crb1 mutations depend upon the\nisoform affected and the genetic background on which it occurs, and their potential interactions. We will identify\nthe molecular basis of genetic modifiers that enhance or suppress Crb1rd8 associated disease phenotypes or\nare epistatic upon Crb1rd8. Through the use of mouse models with isoform specific knockout alleles and\ncontrolled genetic backgrounds, we will determine their contribution to disease variability and the mechanisms\nthrough which they function.\nThese studies address a critical unmet need for acquiring the basic biological knowledge necessary to develop\neffective therapies that can target the pre-symptomatic stage to prevent, delay onset or decrease severity of\nthe disease. Animal models serve an important and unique role to further our understanding of the genetic\nunderpinnings of disease and as a resource to examine tissue pathology, and to perform pre-clinical\ntherapeutic tests that cannot be readily conducted in humans.",

Recent advances demonstrate this\nplasticity is initiated and maintained by de novo translation of pro-nociceptive genes. In animal models,\npharmacological and genetic perturbations of protein translation have shown therapeutic efficacy. Therefore,\ndiscovery of proteins that selectively regulate pro-nociceptive mRNA translation in sensory neurons would\nprovide opportunities for the development of novel targeted therapeutics. mRNA translation is regulated by\nRNA-Binding proteins (RBPs). Our analyses of single cell RNA-Seq data confirmed by histological\nassessments revealed the presence of a RBP restricted to subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion (DRG)\nnociceptive neurons. Previous studies indicate that this RBP binds to and inhibits translation of mRNA\ntranscripts associated with neuronal excitability. Our computational analyses predicted that this nociceptor-\nrestricted RBP would suppress a constellation of ion channels, neuropeptides and other \u201cpain genes\u201d, thereby\nforming a putative anti-nociceptive regulon. This proposal will test the hypothesis that this identified RBP\ntonically suppresses nociceptive transmission by binding to and inhibiting translation of pro-nociceptive\nmRNAs. This proposal will determine if enhancing the function of this RBP is a viable strategy to develop\ninterventions that normalize pain thresholds and reverse chronic pain.

            "project_description": "Early life medical intervention, such as occurs in the neonatal intensive care unit, saves infant lives, but also is\na significant risk factor for subsequent emotional, mood and sensory dysfunction, including chronic pain.\nCritically, there is mounting evidence of significant sex differences in NICU outcomes, with greater mortality\nand gross neurological dysfunction in males and greater risk of internalizing disorders in females. However,\nthe mechanisms underlying these sex differences are largely unknown, a key gap in the literature. Our long-\nterm goal is to understand the neurological substrates that underlie the different effects of neonatal pain and\nstress on vulnerability to negative affect disorders, including chronic pain, during the juvenile period in male\nand female rats. To accomplish this, we will expose neonatal rats to NICU-like treatment including a series of\nrepetitive paw pricks which results in a latent vulnerability. Our central hypothesis is that the underlying\nneuro/endocrine mechanisms differ between the sexes. For example, we have previously demonstrated that\nexposure to a subsequent \u201cactivating\u201d stressor during the juvenile period unmasks alterations to negative\naffective behavior and pain thresholds in both sexes following neonatal pain. However, the neurobiology\nunderlying these changes differ. For example, Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF)-containing cells within the\ncentral nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are particularly responsive during neonatal trauma and are reduced in\nnumber later in life, but only in male rats. Females, although also affected by neonatal pain, do not appear to\nundergo the same changes in the amygdalar CRF system. Importantly, however, intra-amygdala CRF1\nantagonists can reverse the hypersensitivity in both sexes. Thus, while CRF-expressing cells in the CeA are\nonly involved in male rats, CRF receptors are involved in both sexes, suggesting involvement of a non-\namygdala source of CRF in females. Preliminary data point to the hypothalamus. To better understand these\ndifferences, we propose a series of innovative experiments to identify the behavioral and brain changes\nunderlying the different effects of neonatal pain in male and female rats. Specific Aim 1 proposes hi-plex in\nsitu hybridization and florescent immunohistochemistry designed to assess changes in neuropeptide gene\nexpression and cellular phenotypes in the amygdala and hypothalamus to examine differences between male\nand female rats exposed to NICU-like experiences. While the function of some individual genes and\nbiomarkers have been established, many cells co-express several neuropeptides and the various overlapping\nexpression patterns of these neuropeptides has not been studied. Specific Aim 2 looks for changes in\nneuronal activation patterns in identified cell types in the amygdala and hypothalamus and correlates this with\nchanges in behavior, using immediate early gene signaling as a proxy for neuronal activation. Together, these\nexperiments will fill in critical gaps in our knowledge regarding sex differences in the lasting consequences of\nneonatal pain.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nType 1 diabetes (T1D) is often accompanied by other autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune\nneuropathies. Findings in both NOD mice and patients have revealed potential overlap between immune\nresponses targeting pancreatic b-cells and nerves. We hypothesized that lymphocyte populations involved in\nT1D pathogenesis targeting proteins co-expressed in the nervous system may be the earliest responders\ncausing initial damage to peripheral nerves. These first responders provide the necessary trigger to expand\nimmune responses against myelin and other nervous system components traditionally studied in existing\nmouse models of autoimmune neuritis. A vast majority of islet-infiltrating B-lymphocytes in NOD mice respond\nto the nervous-system protein peripherin. Antibodies against phosphorylated peripherin have been identified in\nT1D patients. We recently created a new mouse model (NOD-PerIg) in which B-lymphocytes transgenically\nexpress the immunoglobulin molecule from the peripherin-reactive B-cell clone H280 isolated from islets. T1D\nis accelerated in NOD-PerIg mice. T-cells from NOD-PerIg, but not NOD mice, transfer an autoimmune neuritis\nsimilar to chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) to NOD.scid recipients. This new NOD-PerIg \u00e0\nNOD.scid model of T1D-associated autoimmune neuritis provides an experimental system to directly dissect\nthe discreet stages of nerve cell infiltration and damage. We originally hypothesized that insulitis expanded T-\ncells capable of causing neuritis. However, we have recently determined that T-cells derived from islets or\nsciatic nerves in primary NOD.scid recipients are only capable of infiltrating the organ from which they were\nderived. Therefore, experiments in Aim 1 will address the current unknowns regarding the discrete temporal\nand spatial steps leading to cellular recruitment into peripheral nerves. We have also found that in addition to\nthe presence of IFNg and TNFa producing CD4+ T-cells, there is paradoxically an expansion of T-cells\nnegative for traditional Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines within sciatic nerves. An additional open question is\nwhether peripherin remains the antigen towards which T-cells are responding or whether there has been an\nexpansion of responses against other neuronal antigens. Therefore, studies in Aim 2 will dissect the\nmechanisms by which T-cells destroy peripheral nerves and how an immune response against one shared b-\ncell/neuronal antigen can spill over to a wider neuronal response. Finally, in large NOD colonies, spontaneous\nclinical neuritis can be occasionally observed. We have found that at baseline, NOD mice (around the age of\nT1D onset) already have sciatic nerve infiltrating T-cells. These T-cells are not observed in non-autoimmune\nprone C57BL/6 mice. This indicates the likelihood that NOD harbors genetic loci contributing to spontaneous\nnerve infiltration that can lead to spontaneous neuritis. Whether these loci are distinct or overlapping with loci\ncontributing to T1D is unknown. Therefore, studies in Aim 3 will map genes associated with spontaneous\nnerve infiltration allowing future genetic screening of patients at risk for developing autoimmune neuropathy.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype that accounts for ~20% of breast\ncancer diagnoses. Importantly, non-Hispanic-Black (NHB) and Hispanic women are disproportionally affected\nby TNBC with worse clinical outcomes than non-Hispanic-White women (NHW), even when risks are adjusted\nfor diagnosis and other clinical factors as well as socio-economic factors. This indicates that biological factors\nalso influence the clinical course of TNBC in patients from different racial/ethnic backgrounds. We recently\nidentified robust TNBC prognostic subgroups based on BRCA1/2 status and the levels of an immune-related\ngene transcriptional signature. Specifically, we demonstrated that BRCA1/2 mutant tumors (BRCAmut) and\nBRCA1/2 wildtype tumors with high levels of the immune-related gene signature (nonBRCA-ImmuneHigh)\nassociate with the best therapy response rates (as measured by pathological complete response to platinum-\nbased chemotherapy). In contrast, BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation (BRCA1meth), and BRCA1/2 wild type\nstatus with low expression of the immune-related gene signature (nonBRCA-ImmuneLow), are linked to poor\nresponse rates. Importantly, BRCA1/2 mutations (linked to better prognosis) are less common in both NHB and\nHispanic TNBC patients compared to NHW patients, while evidence from the TCGA TNBC dataset shows a\nhigher prevalence of BRCA1meth cancers (linked to poor prognosis) in NHB than in NHW patients, consistent\nwith the disparities in clinical outcomes. In addition, racial/ethnic differences in TNBC tumor immune cell\ninfiltration have recently been reported. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that at least part of the\ndisparities in clinical outcomes between TNBC patients of NHB and Hispanic ancestry vs. those of NHW ancestry\nis due to different prevalence of TNBC molecular features that associate with better or worse therapeutic\noutcomes. Here, to test this hypothesis, we will assess BRCA1/2 gene status (BRCA1/2 mutations and BRCA1\npromoter methylation, Specific Aim 1) and levels of the immune-related gene signature (a panel of 30 immune\ngenes, Specific Aim 2) in a retrospective cohort of ~300 primary TNBC samples from women of NHW, NHB\nand Hispanic ancestry. We will then determine the prevalence of the four TNBC prognostic subtypes (BRCAmut,\nBRCA1meth, nonBRCA-ImmuneHigh, nonBRCA-ImmuneLow) within each race/ethnicity towards ascertaining\nwhether their prevalence accounts for differences in response outcomes between NHW and NHB/Hispanic\nTNBC patients. Successful completion of this study will generate novel insight into the basic molecular\nmechanisms underlying cancer health disparities and will provide the groundwork for a future prospective study\nto expand and validate the prognostic value of this type of patient stratification across more refined race and\nethnicity subgroups.",

The estimated effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in the U.S.\nfor the 2018-2019 influenza season overall was 47%, but only 12-13% in older adults. There is therefore an\nurgent need to understand the mechanisms that are turned on/off in older adults that result in their limited\nresponse rate to the most commonly used influenza vaccine, Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose. There is also a need to\nunderstand whether and why next-generation influenza vaccines might be more efficacious. Immunosenescence\nis known to be associated with declines in optimal B cell and T cell adaptive immunity, however, our overall\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of immunosenescence is incomplete. The central goal of this proposal is to\nunderstand the mechanisms that lead to a loss of response to influenza vaccine in older adults through\nestablishment of the 3FluAging cohort of healthy older adults who will be vaccinated with three different\ninfluenza vaccines three years in a row.

By identifying responders and non-responders for each\nvaccine and integrating these data with baseline immune status multi-omic signatures, we will determine which\nimmune features can predict vaccine responsiveness.

            "project_description": "Project Summary/Abstract\nChemotherapeutic agents are often dose limiting due to the emergence of a debilitating and painful\nneuropathy, posing a major challenge to the successful treatment of cancer. Recent reports demonstrate that\nmale mice lacking T cells have prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity after treatment with paclitaxel (PTX),\nand only the intravenous transfer of CD8+, but not CD4+, T cells reduced the hypersensitivity. Our preliminary\nin vivo data demonstrates female mice have 2-fold more CD4+ T cells in the DRG than male and\novariectomized (OVX) female mice, and neuronal injury induced by PTX robustly increases anti-inflammatory\nCD4+ T cells in the DRG only in estrogen-competent female mice. CD4+ T cell depletion in female mice prior to\nPTX results in an increase in mechanical hypersensitivity 3 days post-PTX. Our results suggest a previously\nunexplored hormone and sex difference in CD4+ T cells and the severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral\nneuropathy (CIPN). PTX is primarily used to treat ovarian, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer with post-\nmenopausal patients at an increased risk of CIPN; therefore, preventative measures would be invaluable for\nwomen. The mechanism by which CD4+ T cells reduce the severity of PIPN is unknown. In our preliminary\nstudies, DRG neurons from female mice have the capacity to activate CD4+ T cells to secrete anti-\ninflammatory cytokines. Published RNA-seq datasets of DRG neurons show that DRG neurons express\nMHCII, a protein directly involved in T cell activation. Our central hypothesis is that PTX administration in\nfemale mice increases MHCII on sensory neurons to stimulate the paracrine release of anti-inflammatory\ncytokines by resident CD4+ T cells to suppress CIPN. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which estrogen-\ndriven CD4+ T cells reduce the severity of PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy. Estrogen is known to induce\nproliferation of blood CD4+ T cells, but it is unknown if this occurs in the DRG. We predict that estrogen\nsignaling in CD4+ T cells will increase the number of resident CD4+ T cells in the DRG to secrete anti-\ninflammatory cytokines in response to PTX. We expect CD4+ T cells to ameliorate CIPN in female, but not\nmale mice. In Aim 2, we will quantify the extent PTX can enhance MHCII on DRG neurons to induce anti-\ninflammatory CD4+ T cell cytokine production. We predict PTX-induced inflammation will increase neuronal\nMHCII to elicit an anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response in the DRG of female, but not male mice. In Aim 3,\nwe will determine the degree in vivo activation of neuroprotective CD4+ T cells can reduce and reverse PTX-\ninduced peripheral neuropathy. We predict that activated CD4+ T cells will dampen and reverse CIPN in\nfemale, but not male mice, unless pre-treated with estrogen. Completion of these aims will provide compelling\nevidence that CD4+ T cells in the DRG of females are neuroprotective and anti-nociceptive, and can be\nexploited to prevent or resolve CIPN. Neuronal MHCII-dependent activation of CD4+ T cells represents a novel\nmechanism for neuro-immune communication that could be utilized for therapeutic intervention.",

Elucidating these fundamental biological processes are key to a \nprincipled, mechanistic understanding of the adverse effects of cancer therapy and of treatment resistance. \nDuring the current funding period we have expanded, and reshaped, the JAXCC into a new cancer research \nforce with a focus on complex genetics and functional genomics. Research is organized around three \ncomplementary Specific Aims. Aim 1 seeks to develop novel organismal, cellular, and computational models of \ncancer, drawing on the JAXCC's longstanding strengths in model development. Aim 2 examines the genomic \ninstability and genetic complexity of cancer and determines their functional consequences in the cancer cell. \nUsing advanced computational methods and genomic technologies we will interrogate animal models developed \nin Aim 1 as well as patient samples. Aim 3 investigates how key components of a tumor and the host contribute \nto cancer biology, examining the cancer cell intrinsic and extrinsic components of a malignant tumor. Results \nfrom studies in Aim 3, integrated with the genetic alterations identified in Aim 2 with models developed in Aim 1, \nwill allow us to deconvolute the complex interactions of the tumor and host microenvironments. The 53 full \nprogram members of the JAXCC include 33 on the Bar Harbor campus and 20 on the Farmington campus. \nThrough its emphasis on basic research, unique model development, and technological innovation, the program \nleverages funding from multiple NIH ICs in support of cancer-focused research. More recently, we brought our \ntechnologies into the clinical arena through collaborations with SWOG, the Maine Cancer Genomics Initiative, \nCity of Hope, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, University of Connecticut Health Center, and the \nConnecticut Children's Hospital. The program is supported by $10,401,511 direct costs in NCI and other peer- \nreviewed cancer-related grants in the last budget year. Over the last grant cycle, CCSG funds have supported \n379 publications including 30% intra-programmatic collaborations and 72% with external collaborators. The \nefforts of the Co-Program Leaders, Drs. Karolina Palucka and Roel Verhaak, and JAXCC leadership have \nfostered interactivity among JAXCC members through regular Research Program meetings, subsidized travel \nbetween campuses, and the JAXCC Annual Retreat.

The overall goal of\nThe Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center (JAX NSC) Research Development Core is to provide support\nfor career development of junior faculty entering the field of basic aging biology or other investigators who wish\nto change career direction towards basic aging research. In 2017, the pilot award format was changed from\nproviding funds awarded to two investigators per year ($50,000 each) to an innovative in-kind program where\nexperiments were streamlined for awardees enabling more experiments to be performed for a larger number of\ninvestigators within the same budget. During the current funding period, the JAX NSC Research Development\nCore competitively awarded funding and resources to aging projects across biological systems that resulted in\nnew discoveries, research publications and sources of funding, and helped junior awardees to establish their\nown independent careers in aging research. Moving forward, these successes will be expanded by providing\ntargeted funding to exciting projects proposed by investigators new to aging research, and by offering a variety\nof research and intellectual resources to support awardees and other aging investigators in their work. The\noutstanding institutional resources available at JAX, a premier institution for mouse genetics and systems biology\nresearch, will be leveraged to sustain and grow this foundation of researchers at JAX and within the aging\ncommunity. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Fund projects for new investigators in aging research using a\ncompetitive pilot award program. Promising investigators new to aging research will be funded through a\ncompetitive process so they can generate the data and gain the expertise necessary to support competitive\nfunding applications and a transition to a career in aging biology. Aim 2. Provide resources to support pilot\nawardees and investigators new to aging research. Access to resources (e.g., aging mice, data, tissues,\nphenotype platforms, expertise) will be provided to support pilot awardees and other investigators new to aging\nresearch. The aging mouse cohorts and phenotyping technologies supported by the JAX NSC present a valuable\nopportunity for investigators to access material and collect data that might otherwise be prohibitively expensive\nor difficult to obtain. Aim 3. Provide mentorship and career development opportunities in aging research.\nInvestigators new to aging research will be provided with mentorship by JAX NSC researchers and collaborators.\nThey will also be given opportunities for career development in the aging field via support with the grant writing\nprocess, opportunities to participate in aging meetings, and introductions to potential collaborations within the\nbroader aging community. The impact of the Research Development Core is that the pool of investigators\ndevoted to the study of the basic biology of aging will be expanded.",

Tensions between Native communities and researchers generally arise from conflicting\nviews about the priority of topics to study, research agendas, and the use and ownership of data, particularly\nregarding issues of consent, confidentiality, secondary use of specimens, returning results to donors, the need\nfor advance review of publications, and data sharing. In light of such understandable concerns, investigators\nhave been advised to consider the concept of group harm and to extend regulatory oversight for tribal research\nbeyond the protection of individuals to include the protection of social groups. Other important concerns include\nstigmatization of Native communities, relevance and applicability of the studies and their benefit for future\ngenerations, and the need for information on research that community members can understand. These\nconcerns have led to reluctance to engage in research, unless the communities themselves participate in a\nstudy\u2019s design, implementation, and regulation. When these concerns are addressed through regulating\nresearch, engaging communities, improving cultural competency of researchers, and transparency of research\nprocedures, research can be fruitful. The legacy of unfortunate circumstances and the resulting concerns have\nspawned a new era of tribal oversight and regulation, manifested by the growing number of tribal Research\nReview Boards, and their counterparts in urban Indian health organizations. Accordingly, Wabanaki Public\nHealth, a tribally founded and directed public health district serving the 4 federally recognized tribes in Maine,\nseeks to establish a Wabanaki Research Review Board. The Research Review Board will facilitate timely and\nthoughtful reviews, help investigators navigate regulations governing human subjects research, and serve as an\nintegrated pathway for current and future regulatory needs of Wabanaki Public Health and the 4 tribes. Our\nSpecific Aims are to: 1) Build a tribal Research Review Board that will augment the capacity of the 4 Wabanaki\ntribes to self-govern, support and educate investigators and Wabanaki tribal members, and minimize research-\nrelated community harm; 2) Ensure integrity of data, compliance with tribal and federal policies, and protection\nof human subjects; and 3) Educate Wabanaki Public Health leaders and staff and identify strategies to sustain\nthe Research Review Board after grant funding ends. The Wabanaki Research Review Board promises to have\nfar reaching impact on Wabanaki Public Health\u2019s efforts to regulate research and build the regional research\nenterprise. The collaborative design of Capacity Building Project 2 will encourage high-quality, tribally regulated,\ncommunity-based research that improves the health of the 4 Wabanaki tribes.",

However, one challenge is limited access to consolidated state-of-the-art and rapidly advancing research resources, education, and technologies. The NNE-CTR now provides innovative and integrated shared technical resources at partner institutions to cost-effectively support approaches with education and training for optimal use by investigators and trainees in academic medical centers, practice- based research networks (PBRNs), and industry throughout the region. We have consolidated strategic core facilities by leveraging expertise in genomic/epigenomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and imaging technologies with emphasis towards molecular diagnostics/precision medicine. Building upon our success, the goals of the Translational Research and Technologies Core (TRTC) are to provide investigators with support for research based on genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, cell and tissue analyses, molecular diagnostics and novel mouse models for preclinical studies. Our secondary goal is to advance collaborative partnerships among scientists, behaviorists, and physician investigators and support the career development of biomedical researchers. Coordinating with the Community Engagement and Outreach Core, the TRTC will expand educational efforts to facilitate bidirectional communication and to foster collaborations and discovery in translational and clinical research. This research infrastructure, with expanded faculty development in translational and clinical research, will also strengthen the interactions and engagement with the NNE-PBRN and other clinician investigators to support mechanistic and clinical investigations of cancer, cardiovascular disease, substance abuse and other diseases prevalent in the northern New England rural population. Furthermore, the TRTC will build upon established IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) programs and multiple Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE), to effectively leverage resources established by these programs for the enhancement of young and established investigators. The TRTC is currently supporting the development of genomic and cellular imaging-based diagnostics for future public health challenges. TRTC will also support Department of Health initiatives in partnering states and private sector endeavors that likely will require molecular diagnostics. In summary, the TRTC, by integrating unique and essential biomedical research expertise, technologies, and services, will enhance research capacity, credential research programs, and increase the competitiveness of investigators in the region for the benefit of northern New England institutions and the people they serve.",

The program has three specific aims. 1) Funding: The DRPP will provide competitive funding for\nResearch Projects (RPs), Pilot Projects (PPs), and Collaborative Pilot Projects (CPPs) that involve students in\ninnovative biomedical research. RP Leaders, who are newly appointed or early-career faculty, will dedicate 50%\nof their effort to their projects. PP Leaders can be faculty members at any career stage from Primarily\nUndergraduate Institutions (PUIs), devoting 25% effort. CPP Leaders will form multi-disciplinary teams involving\nscientists from different INBRE network institutions. Funding duration varies, with RPs spanning two years and\nPPs funded for one year, with the possibility of one competitive renewal contingent on progress. 2) Mentoring:\nProject Leaders will be partnered with and receive guidance from experienced mentors. RPs will have both an\ninternal mentor from their institution and an external mentor in their research field. PPs will typically have a single\nmentor. Project Leaders will also participate in workshops on data science, grant writing, lab management, and\nother relevant topics, fostering their career development. 3) Evaluation: The DRPP will undergo rigorous\nevaluation to ensure its effectiveness. Project Leaders will submit progress reports, and the DRPP Director and\nthe Evaluation Team will assess project progress toward publications, major grant proposals, and mentoring\neffectiveness using a prescribed evaluation matrix. The External Advisory Committee will conduct semiannual\nevaluations and provide personalized feedback to the Project Leaders and their mentors, ensuring their\ncontinued success. The ME-INBRE DRPP prioritizes innovative projects, particularly those with data science\ncomponents, engaging undergraduate students and leveraging core resources from ME-INBRE and other IDeA\nprograms in Maine and the region like the Maine COBREs and Northern New England CTR. The DRPP will also\nfollow the ME-INBRE Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP). The program's impact will be to increase\nthe amount of and capacity for high-quality biomedical research in Maine that is inclusive of diverse perspectives.\nIt will do so by supporting innovative investigator-initiated research and pilot projects, both standalone and\ncollaborative, and through effective mentorship and research oversight. The program will also promote\ncollaborations across ME-INBRE network institutions.",

Thus, acute care encompasses multiple medical\nspecialties, including critical care services, emergency and urgent care, trauma and acute care surgery, and\nneurocritical care. In rural states, the need for improvements in acute care and acute care research are\npressing, as medical advances have increased the disparities between urban and rural areas. These\ndisparities are due in large part to imbalances in access to specialty-trained clinicians, resources and facilities,\nas well as clinical research. We propose a new inter-departmental Center for Biomedical Research Excellence\n(COBRE) at Maine Medical Center, a tertiary care center located in the largest population center (Portland) in\nthe state of Maine. Serving as the hub of activities, this program will mentor cohorts of acute care researchers\nin significant clinical/translational areas of need while providing a foundation for these studies to impact\ncommunities and patients in all regions of our state. This COBRE is led by Douglas Sawyer MD, PhD, an\nestablished leader in clinical care services, mentorship, and translational research. The aims of this program\nare: 1) Provide the leadership, governance, and advisory network to establish a COBRE in Acute Care\nResearch and Rural Disparities at Maine Medical Center; 2) Provide project and mentorship support to launch\nthe careers of promising clinician-scientists within this scientific program, and help ensure their long-term\nscientific success as independent researchers; 3) Enhance the capabilities of Maine Medical Center's core\nfacilities and research infrastructure to support human subject research of both our COBRE investigators and\nother institutional and external researchers, and to stimulate innovative research methodologies and new\ncollaborations, and 4) Enhance our existing COBRE- and CTR-supported pilot project programs to focus on\ntranslational and clinical opportunities related to acute care and rural health disparities. In Phase I, we have\ninitially selected 4 clinical/translational project leaders with clinical research areas of primary need. These\ninclude: Teresa May DO, a critical care physician-researcher developing a standardized statewide system of\ncardiac arrest post-resuscitation care, David Gagnon PharmD, a pharmacist-researcher testing the benefits of\nprophylactic antibiotics in cardiac arrest survivors, David Seder MD, a critical care physician-researcher\nexpanding his clinical research program to include translational molecular signaling studies of inflammation in\ncardiac arrest, and Alexa Craig MD, a pediatric neurologist engaged in research utilizing telemedicine to\nimprove survival and neurological outcomes for newborns born at risk for encephalopathy. These researchers\nwill be supported by a robust mentorship and advisory network and a Community Engagement, Bioethics, and\nOutreach Core that will develop state-wide health professional and community partnerships in a learning\nhealthcare system to enhance understanding of and increase inclusion in human subjects research.",

Tools for human studies\nhave advanced greatly yet there remains a necessary reliance on mammalian models. To this end new strains\nof mice have been created that better emulate the extent of human genetic variation. These strains include\nCollaborative Cross (CC), Diversity Outbred (DO) and recombinant inbred mice (e.g. BXD). The CC/DO and\nBXD platforms harness the natural inbred strain variation needed for systems genetics studies. However, the\nuse of these strains typically requires additional genetic engineering of the mice to create \u201ctool strains\u201d to allow\nspecific types of genetic manipulations. Such strains already exist for standard inbred strains (e.g. C57BL/6J),\nbut \u201ctool strains\u201d, that carry commonly needed genetic manipulations, are not presently available for genetically\ndiverse inbred strains such as CC/DO, BXD, or all of the founder inbred strains used to create these RI panels.\n The use of the powerful CC/DO/BXD strains is growing rapidly and to facilitate efficient use of these mice we\npropose to create a series of tool strains and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). To do this, we will take\nadvantage of diverse inbred strains that harbor novel, high efficiency recombinase-based docking sites to\nfacilitate the use of CRISPR-cas9 editing for creation of the new strains. Validated new tool strains will be\nmade available through the Special Mouse Strain Resource (SMSR).\n To achieve this goal we will:\n Derive and validate germ line competent mESC lines from existing Bxb1 integrase strains. The goal\nhere is to create a panel of genetically diverse mESC lines harboring Bxb1 integrase sites, as well as LSL-\nCas9-FLAG. These mESCs will provide tools for engineering loci that are difficult to engineer in zygotes or for\nvalidation experiments that can be accomplished in vitro.\n Generate Rosa26-LSL-Cas9-FLAG tool strains for CAST/EiJ, PWK/EiJ, and DBA/2J inbred strains.\nThese strains will enable CRISPR/cas9 editing in the absence of exogenous Cas9. This facilitates engineering\nin zygotes and allows for easy, precise engineering of somatic cells/tissues. The goal is to create and validate\nthis important tool strain for the three high priority inbred strain backgrounds listed above.\n Generate germ line deletion tool strains for CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ inbred strain backgrounds.\nRemoval of specific DNA sequences or engineering stop codons is frequently accomplished using flanking\nloxP sites that serve as catalytic domains for cre recombinase. Implementation of this approach frequently\nuses \u201cgerm line cre\u201d strains, that are not currently available on genetically diverse strain backgrounds. Thus,\nthe goal here is to take advantage of our Bxb1 docking site strains to create Rosa26 Sox2-cre knock-in alleles\non CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ.",

The program supports , biomedical, biobehavioral, behavioral, and translational research in etiology, pathophysiology, screening, prevention, treatment, and epidemiology of these disorders.\nDown syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) is one of the most common genetic causes of intellectual disability, affecting ~1 in 700 babies in the U.S. each year (1, 2), or an estimated total of ~250,000 Americans living with Down syndrome in 2008 (3). Caused by the presence of 3 copies of chromosome 21 in most individuals, this condition is characterized by multiple organ system involvement in addition to intellectual disability. The molecular and cellular bases of intellectual disability due to Down syndrome have been a topic of intensive study, and murine models of the disease exist.\nThe Repository of Mouse Models for Cytogenetic Disorders (\u201cMouse Repository\u201d) began in the 1970s to generate and distribute mouse models for cytogenetic disorders, with special emphasis on Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21).  The creation of mouse models relevant to DS began in the 1970s and continued with the demonstration of genetic synteny between a segment of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16) and human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), which led to the use of the trisomy 16 mouse (Ts16) as a model for studies relevant to DS.  With the subsequent genetic dissection of both mouse and human genomes, other genes present on Hsa21 were localized to mouse chromosomes 17 and 10 (Mmu17 and Mmu10) as well.   Partial trisomies for a number of syntenic chromosomal segments were generated in the 1980s, under contract to NICHD.  One of these partial trisomies, designated Ts65Dn,  proved  to include  approximately  150  genes  located  in  what  is  considered  the  \u201cDown syndrome critical region\u201d of Hsa21.  Subsequently, these mice were produced and distributed, under an NICHD contract, to investigators approved for receipt of them by NICHD.\nDuring the last 30 years, various investigators have generated other models relevant to DS.  These include, but are not limited to, Ts1Cje, Ts2Cje, Ts1Rhr, Ms1Rhr, Tc1, and others.  When these strains and stocks have been made available to the research community, the creation of a central repository has ensured  their maintenance on appropriate  genetic backgrounds and their distribution  to investigators upon request in a timely manner and subsequent to approval by NICHD. \nMany of these mouse strains are maintained under cryopreservation. In 2010, the NICHD reissued the contract \u201cA Repository of Mouse Models of Cytogenetic Disorders\u201d with a substantial increase in investment to ensure  timely  access  to  and  increased  availability  of  mouse  models  for  cytogenetic disorders, particularly Ts65Dn, to the research community, and to ensure increased experimental efforts to modify the existing genetic backgrounds for the various strains to increase availability and ease of use by investigators. At a workshop \u201cAdvancing Treatment for Alzheimer Disease in Individuals with Down Syndrome\u201d held in April, 2013, the participants from the Alzheimer disease and DS research and advocacy communities expressed concern with the limited availability of existing model systems (other than the Ts65Dn mouse) to the research community at large. Since that meeting, the partial duplication strains Dup(16)Yey, Dup(17)Yey, and Dup(10)Yey have become available and are now part of this Mouse Repository. Each of these strains contains a duplication of one of the 3 mouse chromosome regions that are syntenic to HSA21, with Dup(16)Yey representing the largest number of murine genes syntenic to the human chromosome 21 Mouse models for DS available as of 2017 are reviewed in (4) and see Figure below. More recently, the TcMAC21 \u201chumanized\u201d mouse model of  DS  has  been  created  with  Hsa21  inserted  in  a  mouse  artificial  chromosome  (with  mouse centromere and telomere)\u2014this is stably transmitted so mice have approximately the equivalent of 3 copies of chromosome 21 (2 mouse, one human), and share many features of the human condition (5). With  the  launch  of  the  trans-NIH  INCLUDE  (INvestigation of  Co-occurring  conditions  across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) project in June 2018, there has been a renewed interest in supporting  Down syndrome  research in the domains of  basic science, cohort development, and clinical trials. To support component 1 of the project, which is focused on conducting targeted, high- risk, high-reward basic science studies to understand chromosome 21 biology and the co-occurring conditions in DS, there is a pressing need to ensure the availability of high-quality murine models of the  condition  that  replicate  human  traits.  Combined  with  concerns  about  the  Ts65Dn  model\u2019s limitations with regard to modeling the human trisomy, it is important that new model(s) be added to this Mouse Repository.",

During\nresuscitation of neonates, a HALO event, rapid access to appropriately equipped and trained medical\npersonnel capable of delivering time-sensitive medical interventions is essential, or the consequences\nare dire, including mortality and significant morbidity. The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP\u00ae), a\nnational guideline and training program, designed to standardize care and improve adherence to care\nalgorithms, is delivered every two years. However, knowledge and technical skills involved in\nadherence to best practices typically degrade over two to three months if the skills are not used\nclinically. For high-volume, urban teaching hospitals, there is sufficient volume to maintain skills. For\nlower volume rural and community hospitals, there is a lack of opportunities to maintain skills,\nincluding Maine, where neonatal resuscitation is a true HALO event with the vast majority of hospitals\ndelivering less than one infant a day and very few newborns needing any resuscitation. High volume\ncenters across various populations have better outcomes, and in emergencies, patients in lower\nvolume centers experience higher rates of medication errorsand differences in adherence to care\nalgorithms. Studies estimate that 20-40% of neonatal lives could be saved with proper neonatal\nresuscitation and are dependent upon a rapid, knowledgeable, and skillful response. There is an\nurgent need to increase rural community hospital readiness and solutions to improve neonatal HALO\nrelated care delivery. The overall goal of the parent grant, the NIH COBRE in Acute Care Research\nand Rural Disparities, is to support and develop strategies to reduce health disparities due to rurality.\nThis supplement grant proposal seeks to decrease the healthcare disparities experienced by rural\npatients by targeting team-based performance training for neonatal resuscitation. We aim to conduct\na pilot crossover study comparing team performance in NRP\u00ae, teamwork, and communication skills\nwith HoloBabyTM (a novel mixed reality neonatal manikin prototype) and HiFi manikin simulation. We\nwill compare team performance in simulations using HoloBabyTM and HiFi training. Simulations will be\nvideo recorded and investigators will rate NRP\u00ae adherence, teamwork, and communication using\nstandardized scoring tools. We hypothesize teams\u2019 performance with the different simulation\ntechnologies will be equivalent. We also aim to evaluate the psychometric properties of the modified\nNRP\u00ae adherence assessment tool. We will use data collected in Aim 1, in addition to existing\nassessment data, to examine estimates of reliability and validity for the NRP\u00ae assessment tool. We\nhypothesize the modified NRP\u00ae assessment tool is a sufficiently valid and reliable tool for measuring\nteam performance in the simulated environment and will not differ according to simulator type.\nTo achieve our proposed aims, a diverse skill set, expertise, and team approach will be essential.\nThis project aims to leverage simulation expertise, including the neonatal simulation expertise of Drs.\nZanno and Melendi and the pediatric simulation experience of Dr. Mallory. The project will utilize\nsimulation expertise through the Hannaford Center for Safety, Innovation, and Simulation (HCSIS), a\nhigh throughput simulation center for MaineHealth that reaches approximately 5,000 clinicians per\nyear across Maine. Dr. Strout has extensive training and experience in the conduct of clinical and\neducational research across the lifespan, which includes qualitative, quantitative, and mixed\nmethodologies as well as psychometrics and measure development and evaluation. Together, this\nteam is poised to successfully achieve the aims proposed here, advancing scientific understanding in\nthis area and improving neonatal care delivery in rural communities.",

Maine and Vermont have the oldest populations in the U.S. and that, coupled with rurality, predisposes residents to a range of disorders ranging from cancer to substance use disorders, food insecurity, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We are addressing these health challenges by linking primary care practice centers with academic centers and developing innovative approaches to community-based research. During our first four years, the NNE-CTR has built a strong foundation for clinical research. We partnered with the oldest regional practice-based research network (PBRN), the Dartmouth Co-Op, and actively supported successful NIH program applications, including two COBREs, two NCI program grants, an infrastructure grant for a new Center for Biomedical Shared Resources, and a HRSA grant to build on the opioid treatment model pioneered in Vermont. The NNE-CTR PI is playing a leadership role in coordinating a national CTR network, including the CTR National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a registry to share clinical data on Covid-19 nationally, and the NIH-sponsored RECOVER trial, which will define the long-term sequelae of Covid-19. In this renewal, we plan to expand our collaborations both regionally and nationally and strengthen our PBRN. We will strengthen Core resources that include: the Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design Core, which will improve data capability and research navigation services; the Professional Development Core, which will offer an array of new educational and mentorship opportunities; the Pilot Projects Program, which will provide new and flexible funding mechanisms to offer more support for community-based projects; the Translational Research and Technology Core, offering state-of-the-art technologies and training for new investigators, and the Community Engagement and Outreach Core, which will build stronger bridges to communities. We propose three specific aims: 1-Expand infrastructure and resources to address clinical and translational research needs in northern New England; 2- Strengthen clinical and translational research that expands clinical trial access, telehealth, and mentored training programs for new investigators; and 3-Accelerate regional and national collaborative initiatives within the IDeA networks and through NIH such as N3C and RECOVER.",

Despite considerable effort to date, there is currently a lack of\ninterventions or cure, thus there is a clear need for a better understanding of the heterogenous disease\nphenotypes and the underlying genetics to identify more effective preclinical strategies. Rapidly expanding\ngenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic data sets, and emerging animal models of AD\ncreated by the Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (MODEL-AD)\nconsortium, now provide new tools for accelerating our understanding of AD and enable interspecies analysis\nfor mapping findings from mouse model systems of AD to human omics signatures. While multi-omics data sets\nderived from AD and animal models of AD are available to the scientific community through various data\necosystems including the AD Knowledge Portal, a NIA designated FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,\nand Reusable) data repository, a current barrier is mapping disease relevant molecular signatures between\nmodel organisms and humans. Thus, there is an emerging need to provide training in bioinformatics\nmethodologies for systematic interspecies translation of omics-derived signatures of AD. To address this need,\nwe aim to provide a new, and increasingly diverse, generation of researchers, with awareness of available\nresources and to provide skills development for integrating multi-scale data from model systems and humans to\nadvance AD research and interventions. We propose a unique, annual, 4-day workshop at The Jackson\nLaboratory (JAX), that will leverage trainers and expertise from Sage Bionetwork, the host institution for The AD\nKnowledge Portal and Exceptional Longevity Data Management and Coordinating Center, and the MODEL-AD\nCenter at JAX. The proposed workshop, Computational Techniques and Resources for Effective Translational\nResearch in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, will focus on enabling utilization of omics-driven computational techniques\nand analytical principles for cross species functional alignment. Active learning programming sessions will be\nthe core of the workshop, in combination with lectures and interactive forums. Participants will emerge from the\nworkshop equipped with the knowledge and technical skills to conduct rigorous and reproducible computational\nresearch for more effective translational strategies in AD. To achieve this, we propose the following aims: 1)\nfoster utilization of existing data resources from human and model organism studies in AD; 2) deliver hands-on\ntraining on computational techniques that reinforce rigor and reproducibility principles for translational AD\nresearch, and; 3) create an inclusive environment for trainees that fosters networking, collaboration, and\nexperiential learning. Pro-active strategies, including provision of scholarships, will be employed to recruit\nparticipants from historically minoritized and disadvantaged backgrounds to gain their input, provide equitable\neducational opportunities, and to enhance future representation in the AD field.",

Barriers to enrollment include factors associated\nwith patients (mistrust, competing demands, and challenges with follow-up), researchers (extra time and cost\nrequired for translation, enrollment, communication, and regulatory burdens), and system-related factors\n(inconsistent IRB interpretations of federal regulations, and interpreter availability and willingness to document\nconsent). Our recent research regarding local barriers is consistent with prior publications; the system-related\nfactors identified included staff familiarity with federal regulations, availability of interpreters, willingness of\ninterpreters to sign as witnesses, time for consent discussions, and translating short- and long-form consent\ndocuments. Although an increasing number of publications have reported these barriers, few have proposed\nsolutions. Thus, identifying and testing solutions is a key focus area for research.

Multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that results from\nmutated plasma cells, grows in the rich soil of the bone marrow causing breakdown of the bone. The risk of\ndeveloping myeloma is greater in older individuals and people with high body mass index who also typically\nhave more bone marrow adipose tissue, or fat, than younger or leaner individuals. However, the relationship\nbetween bone marrow adipocytes (fat cells) and myeloma cells, as well as the specific mechanisms by which\nbone marrow adipocytes modulate myeloma disease progression are not well understood. Therefore, we aim\nto identify novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients by unlocking new\nvulnerabilities specific to the interactions between myeloma cells and bone marrow adipocytes, which can\nserve as a source of fatty acids and pro-myeloma cytokines. Our cell culture studies suggest bone marrow\nadipocytes induce drug resistance in myeloma cells- recapitulating a common problem for myeloma patients.\nWe have found that one mechanism of cross-talk linking adipocytes with myeloma cells is through proteins\ncalled fatty acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FABP4 and FABP5). We will analyze how bone marrow adipocytes\ncontribute to myeloma by using novel, three-dimensional (3D), tissue engineered cancer models which\nconsist of bone marrow adipocytes and myeloma cells grown together on silk scaffolds. By growing myeloma\ncells in these 3D mini-bone environments, we can determine how myeloma cells change in response to\nadipocytes and discover new ways to target this interaction. We will also use our novel mouse models to\nstudy bone marrow adipocyte- myeloma crosstalk by increasing or removing bone marrow adipocytes in mice\nand quantifying effects on tumor growth and drug resistance. We will use these in vitro and in vivo models to\nspecifically test the role of FABP4 and FABP5 in tumor progression and drug resistance, and work toward our\nlong-term goal to better understand the molecules and mechanisms driving multiple myeloma growth in the\nbone marrow, and how cancer hijacks this niche for its own purposes. This proposal supports this endeavor\nby providing support for a Research Specialist to further develop, lead, and execute the experiments\ndescribed which interrogate a novel part of the cellular \u201csoil\u201d (the bone marrow adipocyte), in which tumor\ncells, or \u201cseeds\u201d land and grow.",

Lack of\nexposure to scientific research resources and mentors, economic factors, and cultural biases are barriers that\nlimit access to quality science education and, in turn, hinder the expansion of our nation's research capacity by\nlimiting contributions from a deep pool of intellectual talent.\nThe program will benefit from JAX's nine decades of success in training scientists at all career stages, including\nthose from underrepresented groups, by its world-leading mouse genetic, genomic, and computational\nresources, and by its well-funded and productive faculty. The program will build upon programmatic infrastructure\nfor career development and a community of post-bacc peers from an existing post-bacc program at JAX. The\ngenomics DAP will be distinct from the existing post-bacc program as the focus for the proposed program will\nbe specifically on career development for basic research in the areas of genomics, genome technology, and data\nscience.\nThe program will host up to six post-baccalaureate fellows in a year with individuals distributed across the Bar\nHarbor, Maine and Farmington, Connecticut JAX campuses. The three primary aims for the program will be (1)\nProvide two-year mentored post-baccalaureate research experiences in genomics, genome technologies, and\ndata science for individuals from underrepresented minority groups; (2) Implement a curriculum that provides\nknowledge, skills, and training complementary to the mentored laboratory research experience and, (3)\nIncorporate formal and informal evaluation methods to strengthen the training program. Oversight for the\nprogram will be provided by two PIs, one from each campus, and by Program Staff from the JAX Genomic\nEducation team. An Advisory Council comprised of internal and external individuals will evaluate the program's\neffectiveness and provide guidance on sustaining a research workplace that is inclusive and equitable.\nThe alumni from the post-bacc program will contribute to building a research workforce that is representative of\nour nation's population. They will bring unique perspectives and individual enterprise to setting and advancing a\nresearch agenda in genomics and data science that benefits all people.",

JAX\u2019s research mission focuses on discovering precise genomic solutions for disease to\nimprove human health in the global community. As part of this mission, there has been an increasing emphasis\non the analysis of single cells, as biomedical research has demonstrated that examination of biology at this\nlevel is essential for understanding the biological processes underlying development and disease. Accordingly,\nJAX has technologies for characterization and quantification of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and\nindividual cell-surface protein molecules present, all at the single-cell level. In addition, recently JAX\ninvestigators have had access to increasingly advanced capabilities in the MSPC in mass spectrometry-based\nproteomics and metabolomics for biological discoveries linking genomics with phenotype. However, despite\nour numerous mass spectrometry capabilities, there is currently no instrumentation here with the capability to\nperform unbiased, high-throughput label-free single-cell proteomics analysis. This gap limits our investigators\u2019\nability to understand biology at the single-cell level, including new insights that would be gained by integrating\nsingle-cell proteome data with the array of other single-cell data generated here, and by addressing the issue\nof a generally weak transcriptome-proteome correlation in organisms. The Bruker timsTOF SCP mass\nspectrometer is the ideal system to address this gap. This instrument offers innovative technologies, including\na dramatically improved ion-source concept, an enhanced trapped ion mobility, and mass analyzer that provide\nultra-high sensitivity, enabling unbiased single-cell proteomics with high reproducibility. The timsTOF SCP can\nachieve coverage of about 1,500 proteins per cell, sufficiently identify post-translational modifications in a very\nsmall number of morphologically or functionally similar cells, and efficiently analyze low-abundant samples,\nsuch as the rare cell populations that many of our investigators study. The timsTOF SCP and its accessories,\nincluding the cellenONE for single-cell sorting and proteomic sample processing, will be transformative for\nresearch at JAX and other Maine research institutions. Various studies at JAX focused on rare immune-cell\npopulations, stem-cell differentiation, sub-populations of cancer cells, the identification of new therapeutic\ntargets for cancer, and characterizing mechanisms underlying cognitive aging will all benefit from this\ninstrumentation. Progress in these research areas are particularly important given JAX\u2019s broadening emphasis\non translating our basic research discoveries into clinical advances that will directly benefit human health. In\nsum, the Bruker timsTOF SCP platform will substantially enhance JAX\u2019s ability to fulfill its research mission and\nwill also bring this potential to the greater Maine community.",

            "project_description": "Maine ranks 12th and 8th in adult cancer incidence and mortality respectively, and pediatric cancer incidence rates are the third highest in the nation, contributing to challenging access to cancer care in our state. In 2018, it is estimated there will be 8,600 new adult cancer cases diagnosed in Maine; cancer is the most common cause of death in our state. Of these adult cases, 6,185 (72%) will receive their care at a MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) hospital or outpatient facility. This patient volume is akin to any major metropolitan cancer center. With only 1.3 million residents, Maine is a small state, is the most rural state, and has the oldest population in the nation. There are significant cancer risk behaviors and exposures, and there are numerous socioeconomic and geographic challenges as well, further compounding our cancer burden. The MHCCN is clearly organized around patient, health provider, and healthcare system multi-tiered strategies and interventions that are prioritized in the NCORP solicitation and defended in this proposal. Our health system embarked upon a comprehensive oncology strategic planning process in 2014 that in a relatively short period has led to the opportunity to submit our response to this FOA. Consensus was reached on the model of cancer care that we would pursue. The singular goal is to ensure that \"the right care, in the right location, as close to home as possible\" will be provided. Cancer patients in our state and their families desire access to state-of-the-art patient-centered care. This NCORP application could not come at a more auspicious time for our organization, coinciding with significant growth and substantive multi-million dollar investment in MH Oncology over the past couple years. With this backdrop, the fundamental goal of our application is to commit and contribute to a robust slate of NCORP activities across the lifespan including pediatric, adolescent and young adults, adults, and elderly cancer patients in our communities and rural care settings. We have assembled a highly interactive and interdisciplinary team across our network to participate in and lead this research endeavor. Our central hypothesis is that developing a highly interactive and interdisciplinary approach to cancer care that is at all times patient-centered throughout MH Oncology will have salutary effects on all aspects of our cancer care across the continuum of prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, end-of-life, and care delivery not only for our patients and their families but for other aspects critical to our mission \u2013 including educating the next generation of healthcare providers and expanding our research pursuits especially in rural areas within our care network. We propose 4 aims: To conduct and actively participate in 1) cancer control research, 2) cancer prevention research, and 3) cancer care delivery research studies; and 4) to capitalize upon clinical research opportunities afforded by NCORP and our newly awarded Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network grant (1U54 GM115517). We will pursue these aims across the lifespan engaging both children and adults. The MHCNN has every expectation that will we make substantive contributions across the spectrum of the NCORP research portfolio. We will capitalize on our institutional assets, patient resources, and expertise from the vantage point of community and rural settings to add value across the lifespan and provide leadership to the NCORP. We welcome and value the opportunity to join the NCORP network as a new institutional member.",

Our Center in Phase I developed a critical mass of investigators with biomedical\nresearch interests in metabolic health and disease, focusing on adipose tissue, bone and skeletal biology, and\nenvironmental, neural, and pharmacological inputs that regulate these tissues. Our COBRE also supported\nthree scientific core facilities \u2013 Physiology, Histopathology, and Proteomics and Lipidomics cores. These\nscientific core facilities provide outstanding services, and have responsibility for maintaining state-of-the-art\ntechnologies in their respective areas by updating technology, equipment, and maintaining current knowledge.\nIn addition, scientific core facilities are responsible for the training of staff, and assisting in experimental design,\nproject implementation and data analysis. We established a robust mentoring network for our junior\ninvestigators, and engaged an external advisory committee to evaluate projects, cores, and our overall Center.\nOur investment in Phase I COBRE projects and pilot projects thus far has directly yielded six NIH R01 awards\n(including funding of the original four junior investigator project leads) with seven COBRE members, one NSF\nCAREER award, one NIH S10 instrumentation grant, and one foundation research grant. Two COBRE\nmembers also mentor PhD students who were awarded NIH F31 fellowships during this time. In year four of\nPhase I, we held a national faculty recruitment that yielded two outstanding new junior investigators who joined\nour COBRE; one in August 2021 (Matt Lynes PhD), and one in August 2022 (Ziru Li PhD). In addition to Drs.\nLynes and Li, Phase II includes support for a third new junior investigator project lead, Dr. Isha Agarwal. These\nnew project leads bring expertise in thermogenic adipocytes, a gut-bone signaling axis, and impact of night\nshift work on diabetes risk in pregnant women. Our Phase II program will build upon our successful leadership,\nmentorship and professional development model. We will focus on expanding our portfolio of research and\nscientific resources under the guidance of an Advisory Committee. Goals for Phase II of this COBRE in\nMetabolic Networks are: 1) Provide leadership to evolve a robust Center infrastructure including administrative,\nfiscal and scientific management to support growth of collaborative research and resources in metabolic health\nand disease, 2) Support career advancement for COBRE investigators and alumni, 3) Maintain high quality\nshared scientific resources, and 4) Build a diverse research community that is guided by principles of diversity,\ninclusion, and equity. Successful achievement of these goals will support professional development of\npromising junior investigators while expanding the use of well-regarded scientific shared research resources,\nwhich are already highly utilized by a researcher user base throughout the country.",

            "project_description": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nResearch and experimental use of pluripotent stem cells has expanded rapidly, and these cells now provide\nimportant research models of human disease and personalized regenerative medicine. However, the majority of\nresearch to date that has utilized stem cells has employed genetically-limited murine cells or clonal human cell\nlines with little attention paid to the impact of cellular genetic diversity on the phenotypic and functional outcomes\nand its relevance to human diversity. Importantly, recent data from murine and human studies of pluripotent stem\ncells indicate that genetic variability is the most significant driver of molecular and cellular differences in\nphenotype, including the ease of establishment of pluripotent cell lines, the rate of spontaneous differentiation,\nreprogramming differentiated cells to a pluripotent state, and the future use of stem cells as personalized\ntherapeutics. Thus, there is now an unmet need, not rigorously addressed at current conferences, to understand\nthe consequences of genetic variation on stem cell biology and their impact on development. To fill this gap, we\npropose the unique and timely conference \u201cDiversity in a Dish: Pluripotent Stem Cells in Genetic Analysis and\nDisease Modeling\u201d to facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and collaborations between experts in mouse and\nhuman genetics, cell biology, and pluripotency, and to engage diverse learners who are the next generation of\nstem cell researchers. We propose an annual, intensive 3-day conference beginning in 2023 at The Jackson\nLaboratory in Bar Harbor, ME. We will bring together 50 scientists, spanning career stages, from the fields of\ngenetics, cell biology, and pluripotency, as well as provide a virtual attendance option for those that cannot or\nchoose not to attend in person. For Aim 1, we will convene an interdisciplinary symposium organized around\ncutting-edge research seminars, workshops that focus on technical skill acquisition, and rigor and reproducibility\nas applied to stem cell research and genomic analyses. In Aim 2, we will promote interactive and inclusive\nactivities, to promote networking, mentorship, learner involvement, collaborative research, and career\ndevelopment. These activities include trainee presentations and short talks, and evening discussions focused\non research projects, rigor and ethics, and grantsmanship. These objectives are facilitated by the residential\nnature of the JAX Highseas Conference Center. In Aim 3, we will promote diversity in both the recruitment of\nparticipants and in the tools being generated to study models of human disease. Diverse attendees will be\nactively recruited, scholarships will be provided to enable in-person attendance, and an inclusive virtual option\nwill enable participation by those that are unable to travel. Diversity will also be emphasized in the context of\nbest practices for research, including the need for studies of genetically diverse panels of stem cells, and fair\nacquisition, representation, and distribution of cell lines from wider representation of backgrounds to ensure the\nbenefits discovered from these biomedical resources are shared equitably.",

These faculty represent a number of different units at UMaine including the Department of\nMolecular and Biomedical Sciences, the School of Biology and Ecology, and the School of Marine Sciences.\nZebrafish have been used by UMaine faculty studying many different disease processes, including influenza,\nmuscular dystrophy, and Candida fungal infections. The Zebrafish Facility is also relevant to UMaine faculty in\ndisciplines such as electrical and computer engineering, who are developing devices and technologies to\naddress the prevention and treatment of human disease processes.\nUMaine\u2019s current zebrafish facility typically operates at 98-100% capacity.

Drug addiction is a devastating and complex disorder influenced by multiple etiological\nfactors. Extensive evidence demonstrates the role of genetic variation on a range of addiction behaviors, from\nexperimentation and initiation of drug use to compulsive drug-taking behavior. Yet discovery of predisposing\ngenes and variants in human populations is limited by high sample size requirements, phenotyping capacity, and\nvariability in drug exposure and other environmental factors. Advanced mouse genetic populations exhibit\nvariation in addiction-relevant behaviors and offer an experimental platform to discover the neurobiological\nmechanisms by which predisposing traits predict the tendency to self-administer cocaine. The CSNA employs\nthe Collaborative Cross genetic reference population and Diversity Outbred mapping population across three\nintegrated research projects focused on three interrelated aspects of addiction susceptibility: impulsivity, cocaine\nsensitization and self-administration. These traits are evaluated using a multidimensional phenotyping platform\nin a mouse population exhibiting extreme genetic and phenotypic variation, enabling a replicable and extensible\nassessment of the shared and distinct biological mechanisms of addiction vulnerability. These complementary\npopulations are derived from the same founder strains, allowing for extensive data integration across studies\nwithin and outside the CSNA. The CSNA develops data integration methods and produces multiple functional\ngenomics and phenomics datasets, deposited in widely accessed and highly functional informatics resources for\nthe global research community. The Center also extends its results into basic neurobiological and preclinical\ntherapeutic research by integrating findings with human genetic and genomic studies, generating novel, validated\nmouse mutants and identifying vulnerable and resistant strains for mechanistic studies. Three research support\ncores provide state-of-the-art approaches to the CSNA research projects and the larger research community,\nincluding a sophisticated, large-capacity Behavioral Phenotyping Core, an Integrative Genetics and Genomics\nCore for statistical genetics, molecular profiling, biobanking, data integration and data dissemination, and a\nMouse Resource and Validation Core for creating and delivering novel mouse resources for systems genetics,\nvalidation, and disease modeling. The Administrative Core coordinates, integrates, and disseminates research,\neducation and outreach activities. Finally, a Pilot Core enables collaborative work to promote innovation and\ndiversity in addiction science. Through its combined efforts, the CSNA will have a lasting impact on the study of\naddiction genetics through the holistic examination of biobehavioral risk, the generation of community data\nresources that we and others will expand and exploit in future studies, and through education and training.",

Moreover, there are unmet needs to lower the barriers to\nparticipation in advantageous training by diverse and disadvantaged learner groups, to provide equitable access\nand, in alignment with stated NIH priorities, to train and diversify the biomedical workforce. To help address this,\nThe Jackson Laboratory (JAX) proposes to provide a traveling workshop, entitled Foundational Training in the\nUse of the Laboratory Mouse as a Model of Human Disease, to be held at partner minority-serving institutions\n(MSI). This workshop will provide learning and skills development focused on fundamental techniques that are\nemployed across a wide variety of animal research and animal models of human disease. The proposed Aims\nof the workshop are: (1) To deliver foundational, experiential, training in the use of the laboratory mouse that\nparticipants can apply to their research and that will facilitate their career development; and (2) To facilitate\nengagement, active learning, and skills development by diverse and disadvantaged learners by partnering with\nMSI to bring hands-on workshops and experiential learning to their institutions. Participants completing this\nworkshop will obtain valuable exposure, perspective, and skills in the use of laboratory mice for biomedical\nresearch and as models of human disease and they will learn techniques that they can apply to their research\nand that will facilitate their career development. JAX is uniquely positioned to execute these traveling workshops:\nthe program will be facilitated by certified and experienced lead instructors from JAX and mobile lab equipment\nhas already been acquired in order to be able to hold this workshop at any partner institution that has basic lab\nspace and a vivarium. Indeed, we have successfully piloted this program at a partner MSI, with highly positive\nparticipant feedback. We will offer the proposed program at no cost to the host institutions or to the program\nparticipants, making the workshop incredibly accessible and inclusive.",

The course will be held August 2023 through\n2027 on the MDI Biological Laboratory campus in Bar Harbor, Maine. The proposed course provides renal fellows\nwith hands-on research education in fundamental concepts of homeostasis and exposes them to the classical\nexperiments that form the foundation of renal physiology and nephrology.\nEight course modules are proposed: glomerular filtration and genetics of renal disease, proximal tubule function,\nthick ascending limb, salt secretion and balance, collecting duct sodium transport/ENaC, water homeostasis,\nrenal stone disease, and acid/base homeostasis. Each of the eight modules runs in three consecutive two-day\nrotations (Monday-Tuesday, Wednesday-Thursday, and Friday-Saturday), with the first day of each rotation\ninvolving intensive experimental work, and the second day involving analysis and presentation of the work to the\nentire course group. Each participant will complete three of the eight planned modules during the three rotations.\nA case study-based Responsible Conduct in Research program will be included in the schedule for all\nparticipants.\nOrigins of Renal Physiology is entirely unique among national renal short courses. The course provides\nparticipants with research tools that give them a deeper understanding of concepts of physiological homeostasis\nwhich is difficult to attain during normal clinical training schedules. The course is open to renal fellows and, since\n2010, on a space-available basis, medical residents entering nephrology. Fellows and residents alike benefit\nfrom close interactions with senior investigators in renal physiology who lead the course modules. Residents, in\nparticular, benefit by working with fellows from different programs and sharing their insights into renal research\nand nephrology.\nThe course is described on the MDI Biological Laboratory website, and in a recent editorial in J. Am. Soc. of\nNephrology (Zeidel et al., JASN 19: 649-50, 2008).

The next generation of researchers will need an\nentirely new set of quantitative skills to fully take advantage of the data they create. In response to this need,\nthe goal of the current R25 proposal is to transform an existing, 5-day bioinformatics techniques course into a\nnew, two-week short course, Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data, to provide a\nunique educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core\ncompetencies in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large datasets. The new course will also address\nNIH priorities including rigor and reproducibility and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)\ndata principles. During the last five years, the Dartmouth faculty who are serving as Principal Investigators\nhave taught a 5-day course at the MDI Biological Laboratory on bioinformatics and biostatistics to ~40\ntrainees/year (202 total). Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback, the current project will extend this 5-day\ncourse into a longer, two-week short course at the MDI Biological Laboratory that will feature a low student-to-\ninstructor ratio (5:1), more hands-on experiential learning, and exceptional faculty who are highly experienced\nin teaching and performing big-data analyses. The new course is designed to accommodate ~35 trainees per\nyear (175 total over the five-year R25 project). It will incorporate modules on biostatistics, scientific rigor and\nreproducibility, and FAIR data principles. The course design will also involve a short conceptual presentation,\nfollowed by an exercise in which students will gain confidence by applying a new skill. Each active-learning\nsession will have three levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) to allow each student to\nprogress at their own pace. The low student-to-faculty ratio will allow course facilitators to guide participants\nthrough realistic challenges without causing frustration. The specific aims of the proposed course include:\nSpecific Aim 1. Develop a two-week short course primarily for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students that\nimproves their ability to design and analyze omics experiments such as RNA-seq, 16S (microbiome),\nmetagenomics, and sc-RNA-seq data; Specific Aim 2. Enhance the impact of research by biomedical\nscientists by teaching them the Responsible Conduct of Research, the secure and ethical use of data, as well\nas rigor and reproducibility and FAIR data principles; Specific Aim 3. Disseminate the training curriculum to a\nbroad audience; and Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of the course on students,\nincluding a long-term follow-up to determine students\u2019 confidence in and actual integration of bioinformatics,\nbiostatistics, and FAIR data principles into their research, and the reported impact of this course on their career\ntrajectory and competitiveness in the job market. In summary, the proposed course will provide a unique cross-\ntraining, educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core\ncompetency in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large data sets.",
